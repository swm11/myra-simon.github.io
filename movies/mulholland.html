<h1>Mulholland Dr. spoiler</h1>

<p> The first part of the movie is a dream, the second part is mostly
real, with a little bit of fantasy and hallucination thrown in. The
first half (before Rita opens the blue box with the strange blue key)
is the dream of Diane, after she puts the hit on Camilla. If you think
about it, you'll understand that it makes sense. </p>
