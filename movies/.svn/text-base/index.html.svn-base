<h1>Myra's Movies</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Ever since I graduated from high school I've enjoyed watching
films, especially foreign and "artsy" ones. As an undergraduate I
joined the University of Rochester film club and went to most of the
movies they showed, thus seeing about 3 films on the big screen per
week. This was my main film education. After I graduated and got a job
I saw films much less frequently, although I would still go out
occasionally. </p>

<p>I had another dense session of filmgoing in the early
years of this century (a rather grand title for 2000/2001/2002) when I
organized a very informal film club for friends in the University of
Cambridge Computer Lab. We would go out about once a week to see some
foreign/artsy film (see my reviews of all the <a
href="movies01.html">films I saw in 2001</a>). </p>

<p> Since having my first child in 2003, though, I have seen very few
movies on the big screen, like maybe one or two a year. But I am still
interested in films, and when I have more time (when the kids are a
bit bigger) I will start seeing films more regularly, and I will again
haunt the local arts cinema.</p>
