<h2>The bike-buying process</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> If you want a bargain bike, the best time to buy is in September.
At that point, next year's models have come out, so bike shops clear
out their old stock to make space for the hot new items. As time goes
on, prices continue to go down, but selection decreases as well. By
February, you might get a very good deal on the previous year's model,
but you'd be really lucky if you could find the bike you want in your
size. </p>

<p> You should buy a bike from your local shop. At least, a shop that
isn't too far away, so you can go back if you have any problems with
the bike. You can often get bikes cheaper if you buy them by mail
order, but if you haven't ridden the exact bike you want to buy bike,
you could very well end up with one that doesn't fit you. Even if you
have ridden the bike you want to buy, you should still get it from a
local shop. Not only can you then get them to fix it if there are any
problems with it, but they will also do swaps for you for little or no
money. For example, they could add bar ends or change the stem,
saddle, or shifters. </p>

<p> Go into all the shops that you would consider buying from, and
see what they have in your price range. Take home a catalog so you can
check out the details of the bikes (frame material, quality of
components, suspension fork, etc). Or you can check out these details
on the Web (see my list of <a href="links.html">links</a> to find URLs
for a variety of manufacturers). This will allow you to find the
highest quality bikes in your price range. </p>

<p> Go back to the shops and try out the bikes. Convince them to get a
bike of your size in, if they don't have it already. If the bike
doesn't fit you perfectly, see how willing they are to swap parts
(e.g. stems) to get it there. After this, you should have a pretty
good idea of what you want: you'll have found a good bike that fits
you. If you're still uncertain as to what to buy, you can post to a
mailing list or newsgroup to ask if anyone has experience with the
bikes you're contemplating. </p>

<p> If you want, you can try to haggle a bit when you buy the bike.
You'll have the best luck trying to get accessories for a reduced
price rather than getting money off the bike itself. Here are some
accessories you will need. 
<ul>
<li> Something to carry water. It's a good idea to start off with a
water bottle and cage. Lots of people use water packs like Camelbak
for mountain biking, but even these people often use water bottle for
short trips.
<li> Basic lights, if there's ever any chance that you might be out on
your bike after dark. These lights are of little use off-road,
but they can be used as torches to get you back to roads if you're out
later than you expect, and from there you can ride safely back
home. Check out some recommendations <a href="vistalite.html">here</a>.
<li> A <a href="toolkit.html">minimal toolkit</a>
<li> Bike gloves. They protect your hands in case of a fall, give you a
better grip on the handlebars, and help dampen shock.
<li> Helmet. You crash alot off-road, and there are hard things like
rocks and roots along to bash your head against.
</ul></p>

<h2>HAPPY RIDING!</h2>
