<title>Cyclocross</title>
<h2>Cyclocross</h2>

<i>January 1998</i>

On Boxing Day (the day after Christmas) I saw my first cyclocross
event, a race in Kenilworth, near Coventry, England. I was really
inspired, seeing these guys (there were about 60 men and a measly 2
women) take their bikes through all sorts of maneuvers (including
carrying them up hills and hopping on them afterwards) on a
semi-soggy, very hilly course.<p>

So I wanted to try it. I probably won't race, but I realized that a
cyclocross bike would work just fine on the kind of tracks we have
around here -- smooth (no rocks, logs, or roots, but some ruts) and
not much in the way of hills. It would be fun to show up on an MTB
ride with what is essentially a road bike, and surprise people by
actually being able to keep up with them on thier all-out mountain
bikes.<p>

I already had a touring bike. It is 10 years old, and has had *alot*
of use over the years, so eventually I've replaced almost everything
on it. The only parts there were original were the frame (not fork),
right shift lever, set post, brakes (cantilevers) and derailleurs. And
anytime I replaced something on it, I made sure that the replacement
was as good as or better than the previous part. Thus I already had a
strong, reliable bike to begin with.<p>

To make it into a cross bike, I took hints from the
<a href="http://www.usacycling.org/cx/">USA Cycling Cyclocross
Page</a> and then ignored the parts that didn't seem sensible to me
(e.g. use tubulars and high gearing). I also asked advice from people
who do cyclocross. Here's what I did to make it into
a 'cross bike:

<ul>
<li> cut 3cm off the handlebars and put on bar-end levers
<li> change the middle chainring (which was set up for half-step gearing,
  which meant that it was not much smaller than the big ring) to one
  right between the little and big rings
<li> take off rack and fenders and put on MTB fenders
<li> take of slick touring tires and put on cyclocross tires
</ul>

I had some trouble finding the shift levers (because my touring bike
still has a 6-speed freewheel) and the tires, but now it's all here
and installed. <p>

I took it for a trial ride Saturday, and then last night took it out
with the local MTBers for a night ride. I just couldn't belive how
well the thing performed! The tracks around here are not very steep
and are pretty smooth, so I didn't risk damaging my 700c rims. It went
through mud patches just fine, maybe better than the MTBs. (Of course,
the tires are thin and not too knobby, that must help.) I felt very in
control on the one little descent we did, and climbing was fine as
well. The frame is a nice flexy steel, and it soaked up bumps at least
as well as my rigid MTB, if not better.<p>

So in summary, it was great!  I'm surprised that there aren't more
people riding cross bikes around here (I have never seen a cross bike
here, other than my own). The people that do ride off road all have
MTBs, which is really overkill considering how tame the trails around
here are...<p>

night-riding buddies as we stopped to regroup last night.<p>
