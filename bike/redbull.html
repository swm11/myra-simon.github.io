<p> The 2001 Red Bull race took place June 24th and 25th. Our team was
orgainzed by Joe, who posted to the University of Cambridge Cycling
Club mailing list with a post that essentially said "The first people
to reply and sign the form get on the team". Those lucky people turned
out to be Shane, Danny, Chris, and myself. There were 5 of us all
together because we were a mixed (male & female) team; the single-sex
teams get 4 people on a team. And then there were the nutters entered
in the solo category. 24 hours on a mountain bike! Urgh, not for
me. </p>

<p> Our training for this race was absolutely minimal. It consisted of
two evening rides in Thetford Forest. These rides were mainly to get
to know each other and to get some practice riding at night rather
than for fitness training. Other than this, none of us did any
training. That is, we didn't do any riding that we wouldn't have done
if we weren't doing this race. However, all of us like riding and get
out for a spin when we can, so we were all reasonably fit anyway
(well, at least the guys were, I'm not fast by any means, but for my
standards I was in pretty good shape). </p>

<p> On one of the Thetford rides Shane, who was trying to get by with
just a Mini-Mag Lite taped to his helmet, crashed and hurt his
shoulder. It was an injury to be concerned about, as his shoulder had
come partway out of the socket and was hurting him a fair bit. He said
he'd be riding in the race, but there was a question of whether his
shoulder would hold out come race day.  </p>

<p> On Friday evening (the 23rd) we loaded up Chris's LandRover and
Shane's car and headed to the venue, Sandwell Park Farm near
Birmingham. We chose a patch of ground in the campsite as far away
from generators as possible, in hopes of being able to get some sleep
during the nights. We had three tents: mine, Shane's, and Joe's. Since
mine was the smallest, and since I was the only girl, I got my tent to
myself, and the guys doubled up. We parked the cars next to the tents,
and that was our cozy but fairly primitive setup. Some people had some
very elaborate tent and awning setups. An awning would have been very
useful, as the sun was bright, and we ended up sitting in the back of
the LandRover to find some shade. We got there at about 9pm, so
after we set up camp and looked around the stands and the start area,
we went to bed. </p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> Saturday morning we got up around 7 or 8, had breakfast, and
wandered down to the headquarters to register. We each got a race
number for the front of our bikes, a race number to where elsewhere in
a visible place, a timing chip, a fluorescent pink plastic wristband
identifying us as competitors, and a black head-cover with Limar
written on it (none of us had any idea when Limar is). In addition, we
got a baton: a small painted wooden dowel, which the rider on the
course had to carry. The timing chips came in a little plastic
envelope along with a business card with our number on it.  We had to
carry them whenever we were racing.  They didn't have to be in view,
so some people carried them in jerset pockets or Camelbaks. When you
finished your lap you went through the timing tent, where some
electrical detectors read your chip and credited you with a lap. Each
person had to do at least two laps, or else the team's score didn't
count.  </p>

<p> After registering we put our bikes together and did a practice lap
of the course so we'd know what to expect. The course wiggled
tremendously, so the 10 mile loop occupied surprisingly little surface
area. The course had two main parts, on opposite sides of the M5,
which we could hear in the background over much of the course.  Lots
of it was over fields that had simply had a strip mowed into them to
make the course. These parts weren't so fun. One in particular was
really bad. It was on the opposite side of the M5 from the
headquarters, and it looked like an innocuous, smooth, straight,
slightly upward stretch across a field. Except that the ground
underneath it was an anstonishing consistency, and it just grabbed at
your wheels and slowed you way down. My reaction to difficult
situations is not to fight them, but simply to shift down. For the
first few laps I'd use the middle ring and the largest cog on the back
to get over this field of treacle, but later I gave in and went for
the granny gear (with second-largest cog on back) to get over it. And
despite going so slowly in my last two laps I overtook a couple people
in this section. </p>

<p> Lots of the section on the other side of the M5 were twisty
singletrack through the trees. I liked most of this. There was also a
part that went along the edge of a pond. I liked this too, simply
because I liked the scenery, also the fact that were some little
steamlets to ford, which got muddier and more worn as the race went
on. There were no long climbs on the course, but there were some very
steep short ones. For two of them (one very near the beginning, and
one very close to the end) I rode them the first time, but for me they
were a struggle to get up even in my lowest gear, and then I'd go
really slow afterwards to try to recover. So I decided to walk up
them, and many others did too. There were plenty of short, sometimes
steep descents, and many of them got very torn up and bouncy as
successive riders dislodged more and more soil. </p>

<p> The last mile or so went along the edge of the campground, so
people would shout out encouragement from thier campsites, and you
felt invigorated as you appraoched the end of your lap.  </p>

<p> After the practice ride, I made up a rota for the race. This
proved to be very useful, so <a href="#rota">below</a> I decribe the
system we came up with.  </p>

<table border=0 align=left cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td><img width=450 height=264
 src="images/rb-bikeholding-sm.jpg"></td><td>
<tr><td align=center><i>me (far right) holding Joe's bike</td><td></table>

<p> There was a pre-race briefing at 1pm, and the race started at
2pm. Joe, our captain, was doing the start, which involved a half-mile
run (none of the rest of us wanted to do it!). At the end of this run,
there was a long field with all 350 or so teams lined up, each team
represented by another team member holding the first rider's bike. I
volunteered to hold Joe's bike for him. The start horn sounded
precisely at 2pm, and the riders (runnars at this point) were off! Us
holders stood and waited. And waited.  Eventually, the riders started
appearing from one end of the field. It was chaos for awhile. Some of
the more forward thinking teams had large banners so their rider could
find his bike more easily. We didn't have one, but I kept a careful
eye out for Joe. When I saw him I shouted his name several times, and
he heard and ran over to collect his bike. He whipped on his rucksack,
grabbed the bike, and said "Where do I go?". I pointed in the
direction I'd seen everyone else go, and he shot off, running with his
bike out of the field. </p>

<p> 45 minutes later I was back at the race headquarters area to start
my first lap. The riders had to dismount as they approached the timing
tent, and they walked through the detectors that read their chips.
Immediately after this was the changeover area. This was a corral
surrounded by a low fence. Riders waiting for their next laps came
into this area, parked their bikes on racks towards the back of the
area, and stood at the front looking for their teammates. At the end
of the first lap, all the teams were there at more or less the same
time. There was no space available on the racks for my bike, so I
leaned it up against the fence at the back. I couldn't get to the
fence at the front (too many people) so I kept an eye out for Joe best
I could, looking over others' shoulders. </p>

<p> Suddenly Joe was on the other side of the barriers, calling my
name. I squeezed to the front, grabbed the baton, fought back, grabbed
my bike, ran headed out of the corral, and started riding. I went
around the course as fast as I could, given that I'm not a very strong
or fast rider. I found myself taking many of the curves too fast and
overshooting them, thus losing some time getting myself back on
track. I thought that I'd better take the curves more slowly. </p>

<table border=0 align=right cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td><img width=314 height=450
 src="images/me-redbull.jpg"></td><td>
<tr><td align=center><i>on my first lap</td><td></table>

<p> It seemed that I was one of the slowest riders on the course (not
surprising, since Joe had put in a very fast first lap). Many many
people overtook me. Almost always they'd say "on your left" or "on
your right" as they came by, and if space was tight I'd edge over a
bit to give them more room. Sometimes it was too narrow for them to
pass unless I moved over quite a bit, so they'd say "On your right,
when you get the chance", and I'd move over and let them by when I saw
an area where I could pull over without hitting a tree or going into
long grass. </p>

<p> Less than an hour later, I was back at the changeover point, and
handed the baton over to Shane. Then back to the campsite to write
down my time. After this I took a shower, as I was fairly dusty from
two laps (one practice, and my first race lap), then had a snack of a
couple of cereal bars. I hear that it's important to eat after you
ride to replentish your glycogen (the stuff in your muscles that
provides immediate energy to your legs) supplies. I wasn't scheduled
to ride again until 10pm, and I finished my lap at 3:46, so I had
plenty of time to rest. At about 8pm I had some dinner and got ready
for my night laps. This involved attaching my <a
href="#lights">lights</a> to my helmet and bike, putting <a
href="#food">energy drink</a> into my Camelbak, pumping some grease
into my forks (routine maintenence for Pace forks) and cleaning and
oiling the chain. </p>

<p> I arranged to be at the changeover point when Danny would have
been on the course 40 minutes: he certainly wouldn't be going faster
than that. By this time the riders had gotten spread over the course,
so I found a place to hang my bike on the racks, and I went to the
rails to look at the incoming riders. I spotted Danny easily enough
and called to him after he came through the timing tent, and he gave
me the baton. I walked to my bike, pushed it out of the corral, hopped
on and started riding. I was going to do two laps so I really didn't
feel like hurrying. </p>

<p> I started my first night lap at 9:20. The official time for sunset
was 9:34pm. There was still plenty of light in the sky so I didn't
need lights in the open bits of the course, but in the trees I would
turn on my bar light to help me see any obstacles. Near the start of
the lap I was passed by a rider dressed all in black with plastic
horns attached to his helmet. They would light up, left horn, right
horn, left horn... I found it really funny, and it cheered me up.</p>

<p> Slowly the light faded away and I'd leave my bar light on full
time. Soon after I turned my helmet light on full time. I had a 12W
spot light on my bars, and a 5W spot light on my helmet. This doesn't
sound like very much, but in fact it was plenty. The helmet light is
the key to it all. You soon get used to moving your head so that the
light points exactly where you want it, so whatever part of the trail
you're looking at is well illuminated. The bar light is useful to
provide some extra illumination in front of the bike, and to help
provide information about the relief of the terrain by casting
shadows, but if I had to ride with only the bar light or only the
helmet light, I would definitely choose the helmet light. </p>

<p> My first night lap proceeded fairly uneventfully for most of the
lap. Quite often I'd be overtaken by other riders, so I noticed the
different lights that people had. Most had had setups similar to mine
(halogen bar lights plus halogen helmet light), or just bar lights.
Some of them had lightswith a very blue-white light, I guess those are
metal halide lights; I've never seen one in person so I'm not really
sure what they look like. Some people had lights that bounced crazily
as they rode. It was disturbing enough for me to be passed by them; it
must have been nervewracking to ride with them constantly! I noticed
that all the riders with the jiggly lights has shorts that said "Sigma
Sport" on them. Then I remembered reading reports on newsgroups
mentioning that Sigma lighting systems have very flexible brackets. I
figured that these people had their lights provided by their
sponsors. Hmmmm, not very useful sponsorship there! </p>

<p> I crashed near the end of my first night lap by being completely
stupid. I'm slow, but experienced at night riding, so I wasn't riding
much slower at night than during the day. I came across a guy who must
have been new to night riding, as he was going very slowly through a
section of singletrack. In a rush of overconfidence, I tried to
overtake him along this twisty rooty bit, and didn't even bother to
say "On your right". Well, I crashed, and I'm only glad that I didn't
take anyone else down with me... The people around me were really
nice, and instead of insulting me for trying such a dumb overtaking
maneuver, helped me up and asked me if I was all right.  Actually, I
was, mostly. I landed on my left knee, and the bike fell on top of my
knee, but it wasn't really hurt, just painful and bruised. I stood for
a minute, then got out my Allen keys to realign my bar end which had
twisted round, then got back on, vowing not to be such an idiot. But
this meant that I was riding my second night lap (all of us were doing
double shifts at night) with a painful knee. Arrggghhhh. Anyway, I
survived, and passed the baton over to Shane. </p>

<p> Back at the campsite I wrote my time down, took a shower (not
wanting to crawl into my sleeping bag covered with dirt), ate a couple
of cereal bars (I wasn't very hungry, but I was aware of the need to
keep up my glycogen levels), brushed my teeth, set my alarm for 5:30
(to give myself plenty of time to get up and eat before my estimated
6:30 next lap) and went to sleep. </p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> Unfortunately I didn't sleep very long. I lay in my tent, resting,
feeling my somewhat painful knee, thinking about the race. I think I
was just too excited to sleep much. Shortly after 5am I gave up, turned
off my alarm, and got up. Joe, who'd finished his double lap shortly
before, was eating porridge (oatmeal). I dug out some canned baked
beans and rice pudding. Joe, horrified that I would each cold tinned
stuff for breakfast, offered me some porridge and was amazed when I
turned it down. I guess I'm not much of a porridge eater (although I
had plenty of it on my <a href="travel/ireland/">Ireland trip</a> last
year, I guess my taste for porridge comes and goes). </p>

<p> The morning was warmer than Saturday morning had been. Joe and I
were sitting around with fleeces on, but any warmer and we'd have
taken them off. Joe warned me that the dew had went the course and
turned some of the surface dust into mud, so I should take extra care
while out on the course. </p>

<p> I really wasn't looking forward to my 6:30am lap. I wasn't even
sure my knee would work: it was painful and stiff, and I was walking
with a limp around the campsite. I took my bike to the toilets to make
sure that I could ride. Happily, riding was less painful than walking,
so I figured I could do my lap. I took over from Danny and started
riding, and my knee loosened up, and then slowly I began to feel
good. I noticed that the course had pretty much dried out while Danny
was riding, so there wasn't any mud to contend with (except for the
bit by the pond). The sunshine was bright yellow and cheerful, and the
temperature was perfect for riding. Birds were singing, and I actually
found myself overtaking a few tired people. Not many, mind you, but
more than on my previous laps. I still ached, and I was too tired to
go very fast, but I went at the speed I could do and enjoyed the ride
around. I didn't even let the field of treacle let me down, and I
joked about it with another rider who was going at about my pace over
it. I handed over to shane with a smile at the end of my lap. </p>

<p> Back at the campsite I ate a can of macaroni and cheese and read
my book for a bit, but then, feeling tired, I crawled into my tent for
some more sleep. Joe had decided to do a double lap at his morning
shift which meant that wasn't going to be riding again nearly noon, so
I had plenty of time to rest. I woke up feeling much refreshed. I got
the bike ready, ate some cereal bars, and headed down to take over
from Danny. </p>

<p> I was tired, and it was much warmer than on the morning lap, but I
was cheered up by the fact that I was less tired than I thought I
could be, and this was my last lap. I wouldn't have to go out again. I
overtook even more people on this noon lap than the morning lap. I may
be slow, but at least I have a reasonable amount of endurance. </p>

<p> Finally I was going along the back of the campsite. Near the
end. One annoying uphill (I pushed up the very steepest bit) then it
was downhill to the timing tent. I handed over the baton to Shane, and
I was done. DONE! NO MORE RIDING! I took a few piccies, then headed
back to the campsite, then took a shower, then back to the campsite
where I crawled into the back of the LandRover to get out of the
sun. I tried reading, but kept nodding off. I crawled into my tent and
slept some more.  </p>

<p> Chris did the final lap. I really felt that I should go down to
cheer him when he came in, but I didn't have the energy. After Chris's
shower we packed up to head out. I barely had the energy to pack away
my tent and scattered equipment. As soon as we set out (I was in
Shane's car) I fell asleep again. We stopped at a service center for
food about 30 miles after getting on the motorway towards Cambridge,
but I just stayed in the car and slept. Eventually I woke up, and I
read my book until they came back. When we got back to Cambridge,
Danny's brother was there to take him and his stuff home, and Chris 
dropped Joe and I off at our houses. I had recovered enough that I was
actually able to help shift baggage around when people extracted their
stuff. And then finally I was at home. I did a bit of unpacking, a bit
of laundty, ate some more, and then finally went to bed about
11pm. Despite all the sleeping I'd done during the day, I slept
solidly through the night. </p>

<p> And how did we do? Not too badly, really. Of the 101 teams in our
category (mixed, ie both men & women), we came in 34th. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="rota">
<h2>The Rota</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p> After our practice run, before the race started, I made up a rota
of riders. I tend to feel a bit unsettled unless things are planned
out in advance, so I wanted to have a plan for who would do what when
for the entire race. I knew that it was highly likely that the plan
would have to be highly revised due to any number of reasons (in
particular I was worried that Shane's shoulder might give out under
the strain), but I felt it was better to have a schedule to alter
rather than making everything up as we went along. We each gave an
estimate as to how long it would take us to get around the course. Joe
and Danny estimated 50 minutes, Chris and Shane 55 minutes, and I a
hour or a bit over. </p>

<p> The main constraints were that Joe was starting, and Danny didn't
want to ride when it was truly dark, since he didn't have any
experience riding off-road at night. In addition, I wanted to do a
double lap early in the night (starting at say 10pm) and then only go
again after everyone else had gone twice, so I'd have a chance of
getting a full night's rest. Shane, Chris, and Joe also decided to do
double laps at night, so they'd have lots of time to rest before going
off again. So I put Danny riding at about 9pm, before sunset, and
doing a double lap at dawn. With the assistance of the guys, I filled
in names between these fixed points so that we'd each get to ride
about the same number of laps, and we'd have enough of a gap between
our rides to have time to recover. I also put next to the rider an
estimated start time, based on the race start time and the estimated
lap times of the riders. (I gave everyone a lap time of one hour for
night laps, which turned out to be a decent estimate.) </p>

<p> Then I realized that in order to know when to head to the corral
for changeover, we'd need to have accurate knowledge of when the rider
out on the course actually left. So I drew two columns to the right of
the rota for Actual Start and Actual Finish times, and I told the guys
that it was really important that when they finished a lap, that they
needed to remember when they finished and come back to the camp site
and write it down. This time would also be the start time for the next
rider, so we always knew at what time the rider on the course had
left. Noting the time you finished turned out to be pretty easy as
there was a huge digital clock as you walked into the timing
tent. </p>

<p> The estimated start times proved to be useful as well. During our
rests it was important to know roughly when we'd be riding again. So
we'd look to the start time for the rider out on the course to find
out how far off the schedule we were (we were a half hour ahead of
schedule for a good deal of the race), then adjust our estimated start
times by that amount. </p>

<p> I don't know if other teams had this kind of system, but it worked
very well for us. The only change we made to the plan, once it was
worked out, was that Joe took a double lap during his morning shift,
as he was our fastest rider, and he calculated that we'd get an
extra lap in if he took did two at that point. Here's a <a
href="rota.html">table version</a> of what our final rota looked like,
with actual start and finish times filled in. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="lights">
<h2>Lights</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p> I have a hybrid lighting system. The bar light is a 12W <a
href="http://www.lumicycle.co.uk/">Lumicycle</a> spot bulb, powered by
the stock Lumicycle battery. The Lumicycle system is a very good
one. They use good 12V bulbs available in a wide range of powers (5W
to 35W), most powers available in spot (7-10 degrees) and flood (30-38
degrees) versions. The battery consists of 11 4Ah NiMH cells,
supplying 13.2V to the bulbs. This overvolting makes the lights much
brighter for only a modest increase in power consumption, so it's a
real winner. The battery has the nice combination of being small and
light and storing lots of energy (it will power the 12W bulb for 3.8
hours). </p>

<p> My helmet light is based around a VistaLite lighting head. This
lighting head is the same one that's used with the current Nightstick
system, although the helmet mount I use (made by VistaLite) is
different from the one they currently make. The bulb is a 5W spot bulb
to allow for a long run time with a reasonably lightweight
battery. The bulb is actually meant to be run at something like 5.5V
volts, so applying 6V to it overvolts it, giving a brighter light (as
with the Lumicycle system). The battery is a homemade job. It is 5
2.8Ah NiCad C cells side by side, making a reasonably compact, light
package that will power the light for at least 2.8 hours. </p>

<p> Both batteries are charged with smart chargers. For the Lumicycle
battery, I have the Lumicycle fast charger, which I highly recommend
for anyone thinking of buying a Lumicycle system. It prevents you from
damaging the battery by overcharging it. The C-cell battery I use for
the helmet light is charged by a Black & Decker power tool charger, <a
href="charger2.html">modified to charge bike light batteries</a>. </p>

<p> The only improvement I would like to make to this system is to
swap the VistaLite-based helmet system for a Lumicycle-based system,
with a 12W spot bulb and stock Lumicycle battery. That way I'd get a
brighter helmet light with a longer run time, and be able to use the
same charger to charge both helmet and bar light batteries.  </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="food">
<h2>Food & Drink</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p> In a 24 hour race, you need to eat. Lots. And since you'll be
tired, you'll want food that requires little to no effort to eat.  You
can just eat food from the food stands: they have decent stuff like
pasta & noodles. Danny did this, as he was travelling very light. But
if you want to save some money, you'll cook your own. Here was what
we ate.

<ul>
  <li> Joe liked his porridge (oatmeal) for breakfast. He has the oat
      premixed with nice stuff like muisli nut and raisins, and after
      it was cooked he added a banana. Actually, as far as porridge
      goes it didn't look too bad.
  <li> Oriental noodles (the thin ones that take 3 mins to cook) were
      popular. They take up little space and are light, so toss a few
      in your bag for the trip.
  <li> Several of us bought little plastic pots that had dried
noodles, pasta, rice, or cous cous with a sauce in them. You peel back
the lid, add boiling water, let sit for 5 mins, and voila, hot food!
      These are very light to carry, but take up alot of room in your bag.
  <li> I had cans of ready to eat stuff, like baked beans, macaroni
      and cheese, and spaghetti rings. These are the ultimate in easy
      to prepare food, especially if they have pull-tab lids. Just
      peel back the top, eat with a spoon straight from the can, don't
      even bother to heat. The baked beans and spaghetti rings were
      the best: low fat instant hit of carbohydrates! Even pretty easy
      to chew! Unfortuntately, not only do these take up alot of space
      in your bag, but they're also heavy.
  <li> Cakes were important to round off our caloric intake. Shane's
      girlfriend had baked him a carrot cake, which we all enjoyed. I
      had a ginger cake and malt loaf along, and Chris had some little
      ready to eat pies.
  <li> Cereal bars or chocolate bars are also useful to give you
      that caloric hit
      with no effort on your part, and they have the advantage of
      coming in small portions, so you can just open one and not
      worry about whether the rest will go stale. I would eat a couple
      of cereal bars them immediately after
      finishing laps, whether I was hungry or not, to help replentish
      my glycogen supplies. They are also a good to take along on
      laps. You really don't want to be stopping to eat them, or
      trying to eat one while you ride, so you should be eating
      plenty before you start your lap so you don't need to eat while
      you're out. But if you've screwed up your calorie intake, a few
      cereal bars could make the difference between finishing the lap
      on your bike or pushing it because you've depleted all your
      energy stores.
</ul>

<p> You need to drink. Lots. We drank liter after liter of water, both
on the course and at the campsite. We'd occasionally make it into tea
(normal or herbal) but usuaully just drank it neat. The race
organizers gave each team two packs (each 6 x 1.5l bottles) of still
mineral water, which was much appreciated. All of us except Shane
carried Camelbaks (or other brand of backpack hydration system). The
main advantage of Camelbaks are that you can very easily drink even on
fairly difficult terrain: grab the hose (you know where it hangs so
you can do this without looking), shove into your mouth, drink, spit
it out. Done, you're hydrated. Also, Camelbaks stay with you, while
water bottles can jump out of their cages. Towards the end of the
race, the downhills were littered with collections of lost wter
bottles. </p>

<p> We didn't use energy drink very much. Chris did mix up a water
bottle that he carried around in addition to his Camelbak so he could
have both at hand. I used water in my 'bak most of the time. I
normally don't put energy drink into my Camelbak, as it promotes the
growth of mold, and I don't like messing with trying to get rid of
it. But during my double night lap I was going to be making a pretty
hard (for me) effort for two hours. I knew I wouldn't want to try to
eat cereal bars while riding, and I certainly didn't want to stop to
eat, so I'd have to get my calories in my water. I don't like drinking
very sweet stuff, so usually when I use energy drink (in water
bottles) I use it much more diluted than the mixing directions
suggest. However, to make sure I got enough calories I mixed it up
almost full strength, 120g in 3 liters of water to make a 4%
carbohydrate solution. It was really too sweet for my tastes, but I
put up with it. </p>
