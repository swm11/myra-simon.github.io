<h1>Care and feeding of bike light batteries</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Much of this information is in the <a
href="lights.html">High-Powered Lighting Systems</a> article, but I've
put the info here in a somewhat more informal way. </p>

<p> The most powerful lights, and the most expensive ones, are those with
separate lighting heads and batteries. The battery is a substantial
cost of the lighting system. The battery is also the most likely thing
to die and leave your lighting system unusable. So taking care of your
battery is essential. Unfortunately, many systems come with lousy
chargers and inadequate instructions, and there are quite a few myths
out there about rechargeable batteries that make things even more
difficult. </p>

<p> The three major kinds of battery are sealed lead-acid, NiCad (nickel
cadmium), and NiMH (nickel-metal hydride). As you go from lead-acid to
NiCad to NiMH, the batteries get more expensive, and are smaller and
lighter for the same capacity. So if you have lots of money you
probably have a NiMH system, while if you're on a tight budget you
probably have one with a lead-acid battery. These batteries have
different characterists and charging requirements, but they all have a
couple things in common: none of these batteries likes to be
overcharged, and you should never 100% discharge any battery. So when
your lights go dim and yellow, no matter what kind of battery you
have, turn off your lights. </p>

<h4>Lead-acid batteries</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Lead-acid batteries slowly drop in voltage as they power your
lights. This means that your lights will dim slowly as they get
empty. Once they get noticeably dim, turn them off, as lead-acid
batteries are easily damaged when discharged too low. They are not
very good at providing high currents: if you hook them up to a very
bright bulb they'll go flat very quickly. What's too high a current
for your lead-acid battery depends on the voltage of the battery
(whether 6 or 12V) and the make of battery. For a standard cheap 6V
battery, 10W is about the most you can get out of it, while a Hawker
Cyclon battery can supply 20W easily. If you want more than this,
you'll have to use NiCads or NiMH batteries. Lead-acid batteries also
lose capacity when it's cold (near or below freezing).  </p>

<p> Lead-acid batteries are best charged using a constant voltage
source. There are two basic ways of charging them: quickly and
slowly. The voltage for a quick charge (also called bulk charge) is
higher than the voltage for the slow charge (also called float
charge). The problem is that if you leave your battery attached to the
higher (bulk) voltage for too long, you will destroy it. So a proper
fast charger detects when the battery is full and switches to a float
voltage. If you attach your battery to the float voltage, it charges
slowly, but then you can leave it hooked up to this voltage forever
and the battery will be just fine. </p>

<p> The chargers that come with lighting systems that use lead-acid
batteries are almost always simple AC/DC chargers. They usually apply
a voltage that is far too high for the battery, and will kill it if
you leave the battery plugged in for too long. Unfortunately, while
the instructions you get with the lights tell you how long a full
charge would be (i.e., how long you'd charge after you drained the
battery until the lights went noticeably dim), if you recharge for
this entire amount a battery that's only partly discharged you will
end up overcharging it. So you have to guess how much of the capacity
you've used, and cut down the charging accordingly. So for example, if
you estimate that you've used half the capacity of the battery and 8
hours is a full charge, then charge for at most 4 hours. But this
requires guessing how much you've used the light, which can be
difficult if you're using different powers of bulbs or turning your
lights off when you're not using them. </p>

<p> To avoid this guesswork and keep your battery fully charged but not
overcharged, you should get a proper charger. You can buy a good fast
charger from Maplin (see their 
<a href="https://catalogue.maplin.co.uk/mainframe.asp">catalog</a>,
look left for headings Electrical, then Batteries & Chargers, then
Chargers then Sealed Lead Acid Battery Chargers, they cost 30 quid or
more), or you can make your own float charger for very little money
(see <a href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/charger.html">my
article</a> on it). While it may seem
like alot of expense or bother for a lighting system that's reasonably
cheap, remember that it won't work at all if your battery dies through
having been overcharged or over-discharged. </p>

<p> Lead-acid batteries last the longest when they are kept topped up, so
you should charge them as soon as possible after you use them, and
when you put them away for the summer you should make sure they're
fully charged up.  </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>NiCad batteries</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> NiCads are a better choice than lead-acid batteries for many
situations. They stay at about the same voltage through most of their
discharge cycle, so they keep your lights nice and bright until the
battery is nearly empty, then they go dim very quickly. They are
generally a fair bit lighter than a lead-acid battery for the same
capacity, and often smaller as well. They can handle high currents
better than lead-acid batteries. They also work better in the cold,
although they are affected by extreme cold (like you get in
Alaska). However, they self-discharge, losing 1-3% of their capacity
per day, so they aren't as useful if you want to have a rechargeable
system ready to go at a moment's notice. </p>

<p> Like lead-acid batteries, they suffer when overcharged and can be
damaged by being fully discharged. Unfortunately, there seem to be
quite a few myths about these batteries. The most prevalent one is
that they can't be topped up after being only partly discharged
because they have "memory", so they will remember this and only allow
you to use this amount of capacity in the future. </p>

<p> This only bears a faint resemblance to the facts. NiCads do suffer
from "memory" but it is not a reduction of the capacity of the
battery, but a reduction of the voltage of the battery. A battery
suffering from memory will still power your lights, but since it does
so at a slightly lower voltage than it would if it were in top
condition, the lights look a bit dim and yellowish. Second, it is not
caused by topping up your battery after only a partial discharge; it
is caused by overcharging your battery by leaving it plugged into a
stupid charger (the kind supplied with most bike lighting systems)
after the battery is already charged. Third, memory isn't
permanent. If you have a battery suffering from memory (dim lights
even when fully charged), here's how you fix it: do a carefully
controlled discharge. What you want to do is discharge the battery
until its voltage is down to 1V/cell. For a 6V battery, this is 5V.
If you don't have a voltmeter, you can approximate this by discharging
until your lights start to get noticeably dim and yellow. Then turn
the lights off: never 100% discharge your battery, or you can destroy
it. </p>

<p> The best way to avoid getting memory is using a smart
charger. This charges your battery until it is full, then switches to
a tiny current that counteracts self-discharge. Smart chargers for
NiCads batteries are harder to find than for lead-acid, so the easiest
route is to modify a power tool charger (info <a
href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/charger2.html">here</a>). If you
don't want the expense or trouble of this you should try to estimate
how much you've discharged your battery, and cut down the charge time
accordingly, as described for lead-acid batteries. Then if you
discover you've got memory, do the carefully controlled discharge
described above. </p>

<p> NiCads don't need to be stored full; they can be left in whatever
state they were when you finished your ride. Since they
self-discharge, I tend to leave them uncharged until the evening
before my next night ride, when I charge them up.  </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>NiMH batteries</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> NiMH batteries are the best technology currently offered in bike
lights, and they are correspondingly the most expensive. They tend to
be smaller and lighter than NiCads with a similar capacity. In many
ways they are similar to NiCads: they self discharge at about the same
rate, they can supply high currents well, they work better than
lead-acid batteries in low temperatures, and they can be left in any
state (charged or part discharged) when stored. </p>

<p> Like NiCads they suffer from overcharging. There is a myth that since
NiMHs don't suffer from memory that you can charge them up as often or
and as much as you like. This very misleading: NiMHs don't suffer from
"memory", but they dislike overcharging even more than NiCads. The
result of overcharging is permanent damage to the battery rather than
the curable problem of "memory". If you overcharge your battery using
a stupid charger, you will greatly reduce its lifetime. This is why
many systems come with smart chargers. If you have a choice between
similar systems, one with a stupid charger and one with a smart
charger, go for the second one. It will save you buying a new battery
if you kill the first one. </p>
