<h1>Sealed Lead-Acid Battery Charger Circuit</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> <b>WHY?</b> If you buy a commercial bike lighting system, it most
likely comes with a lousy charger.  For example, with my VistaLite 430
I got a charger that provides 7.5V/300mA DC to the battery. There are
two problems with this. First, the charger doesn't charge the battery
particularly fast (because it doesn't put much current into it).
Second, when it's done charging, it's still applying 7.5 V across the
battery, which will probably damage the battery if it's left plugged
in for more than about a day or two.</p>

<p> The lighting maufactorers would like to be able to include a better
charger with their systems, but the cost for a smart charger is
prohibitive for something that doesn't obviously increase the
performance of your lights. Thus they make do with the simple chargers
they include, and they issue many warnings to disconnect the charger
after a certain period of time.</p>

<p> Here's how to make a good charger for a sealed lead-acid battery (this
will NOT work with NiCad batteries) that's faster (because it allows
more current into the battery initially) and safer (because it uses
lower voltage when the charging is finished). The battery can be left
plugged into this charger indefinitely, and it won't bother it in the
slightest. In fact this is the "float" or "standby" charging method
recommended by battery manufacturers. Below is a circuit based around
an L200 chip. (Note to US residents: the L200 is more easily available
in Eurpore than in the US. I hear that they are available in the US from 
<a href="http://www.bgmicro.com">BG Micro</a>. If BG has run out, you may
consider an 
<a href="LM317.txt">equivalent</a> made from an LM317 chip.)
This is a well-known circuit; the diagram
below, copied from <i>More Advanced Powed Supply Projects</i> by
R.A. Penfold, is almost identical to one found in a <a
href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/">Maplin Electronics</a>
catalog which sells the chip. The charger can be used for both 6V and
12V batteries.</p>

<p> Please note that this is not a smart charger. A smart charger
charges at a high voltage (the "fast" or "bulk" charge voltage), and
then, when it detects that the battery is full, it switches to a lower
("float" or "standby") voltage. This charger just sets the voltage to
the float voltage all the time. The only disadvantage of this charger
over the smart charger is that this charger charges the battery more
slowly. Both types of charger are very good for the battery and will
not harm it in any way, even if left attached for weeks. </p>

<p> I myself am not much of an electronics person. Thanks go to

helping me to understand the nuances of this circuit.</p>

<h3>If you're lazy</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> Maplin sell a little kit with all the bits in it. However it's a
fair bit more expensive than just buying the parts yourself and
soldering them to a strip board. 

</blockquote>

<h3>What you need to make the charger</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> You need the following parts:
<ul>
<li> an L200 chip
<li> an AC/DC converter
<li> a strip board and wires
<li> a few resistors (including one variable resistor) and capacitors
<li> a box to put it all in, preferably aluminum
<li> connectors for your battery and the AC/DC converter
<li> various screws to put everything together
</ul>

<p> You need the following tools:
<ul>
<li> a soldering iron
<li> a multimeter (well, probably just a voltmeter would do)
<li> a drill to put holes in your box
<li> various files, screwdrivers, and wrenches
</ul>

<p> The main body of the L200 chip (made by SGS-Thomson) is about 1cm on a
side, and it has 5 pins and a tab for attaching to a heat sink. The
chip as used in the circuit below acts as a voltage regulator with
current limiter. The current limiting aspect is important in order to
keep the current within the range that the AC/DC converter can safely
deliver.</p>

<img src="images/ch1-circuit.gif" alt="circuit diagram"><p>

<p> The capacitors C1 (of 220 nanoFarad) and C2 (of 100 nanoFarad) smooth
out the input and output voltages. This is important because the L200
has a feedback loop where it takes voltage readings that depend on its
output and then changes its output in responce. This can induce some
oscillations in its output. The size of the capacitors is appropriate
for smoothing out this frequency.</p>

<p> R2 should be an 820 Ohm resistor. R1 should be a variable
resistor, with maximum value somewhat larger than the computed ideal
resulting from the second equation. It's best if it can be adjusted
very finely, as you want to be precise about the output voltage of
your charger. The value of R3 sets the maximum current the circuit
will produce (up to about 2A). The relevant equations are:</p>

<p> Vout (in volts) = 2.77 * (1 + R1 / R2)</p>

<p> R1 = (Vout/2.77 - 1) * R2</p>

<p> R3 (in Ohms) = 0.45 / Imax (in amps)</p>

<p> where Vout is the voltage drop across the output (between + OUT
and - OUT, this is the voltage applied to your battery), and Imax is
the maximum charging current. To determine what Imax should be, find
the manufactorer's charging recommendations for your battery. Some
batteries, like my Hawker Cyclon don't need to have the current
limited when they are being charged with constant voltage. Still, you
have to pick some value, and you'll want it to be less than than the
2A max that the L200 will deliver and less than the max current your
AC/DC converter is rated for (which is clearly written on the
converter). I used a resistance of about 0.5 Ohms to limit it to about
1A, as the AC/DC converter I used (see below) is rated for 1A.</p>

<p> You can see that with this circuit you'll get an output voltage
anywhere between about 3V and 33V. Thus, practically speaking, it can
be used as a charger for either a 6V or 12V battery depending on how
you set the resistor R1, and which AC/DC converter you use.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>How the circuit works</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> I have no idea how the L200 does what it does, but I'll tell you
roughly how it operates in this circuit. Pin 5 provides the output
power. All the current coming from there goes through R3. Pin 2 is an
input to an internal voltmeter, which detects the voltage drop between
Pins 5 and 2. If this voltage drop is greater than 0.45 V, then there
too much current going out. Pin 4 is an input to another internal
voltmeter, which detects the voltage drop between Pins 4 and gnd (Pin
3). The L200 sets the voltage on Pin 5 so that the voltage on Pin 4 is
2.77, assuming the current is lower than Imax. But if there too much
current on the output, it drops the voltage on Pin 5 to keep the
current in bounds. In this case you'll get less than your desired
voltage on the output.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Dealing with heat</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> Since all the current on the output flows through R3, it can get hot. The
relevant formula is P = V*V/R, so the maximum power going through it
is 0.45 * 0.45 / R3. Since I set R3 to about 0.5 Ohm in my circuit, I had
about 0.5 W being consumed by the resistor. Make sure you have a
resistor that will tolerate the heat you're putting into it.</p>

<p> The L200 can get pretty hot as well. Attach the metal tab to a heat
sink. If the box you're putting it into is alumimium, and you're not
generating too much heat, attach it to this. The maxumim power
dissapated by the L200 can be estimated by the (Vin - Vout) * Imax,
where Vin is the voltage across the input.  With my circuit, this is
about 2V * 1A = 2W. This is not too much and it is sufficient to
attach the tab to the box (I find that the box does not get hot as the
battery charges). Note that if you do this, the metal tab is connected
internally to Pin 3 (gnd), so this will make your box grounded. If
you're dissapating too much power in your L200 you might contemplate
attaching the chip to a commercial heat sink and drilling lots of
holes in your box.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>How to use this circuit</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> <i>Connections for power and battery.</i> You need to supply power
to this circuit. By far the easiest way is to get a cheap AC/DC
converter. The L200 requires that Vin is at least 2V higher than the
desired output voltage (Vout). But if it's much higher you'll lose
alot of power in the chip, which just acts as a very smart variable
resistor. If you're charging a 6V battery, you'll need Vout to be
something like 7V, and so Vin should be about 9V. I have a 9V/1amp
converer, and that works just fine. To charge a 12V battery, you'll
need Vout somewhere about 14V, so use a 16V or 17V input.</p>

<p> Presumably, your converter has a plug of some kind on it. Buy a
matching socket and put it in your box. Pay attention to the polarity
of the plug. If the outside part of the plug is positive and you've
got a metal box and have attached the L200 to it, then make sure
you get an insulating socket.</p>

<p> You'll also have to hook up your battery. Get a socket that matches
the plug on your battery and install that in your box, again paying
close attention to the polarities. </p>

<p> <i>Selecting output voltage.</i> Find the charging recommendations
for your battery and choose a voltage somewhere in the float charging
range. Power up your circuit (attach the AC/DC converter and plug it
in, but don't attach the battery) get your multimeter, and adjust R1
until the voltage Vout is correct.</p>

<p> Here is an example for setting the voltage. My battery is a 
<a href="http://www.hepi.com/monobloc.htm">6V Hawker Cyclon Monobloc</a>,
which consists of three Cyclon cells encased in a plastic shell. 
The <a href="http://www.hepi.com/cyccharg.htm">
charging info page</a> for the battery shows this table:
<pre>
Constant voltage (CV) charging should be within the following ranges: 

 Fast Chargers:         Per cell: 2.45 to 2.50 volts @ 25°C 
                        12 volts: 14.70 to 15.0 volts @ 25°C

 Float Chargers:        Per cell: 2.27 to 2.35 volts @ 25°C
                        12 volts: 13.62 to l4.10volts @ 25°C
</pre>
The voltage in the charger (Vout) should be set to something in the
float range. I chose 2.3V/cell. Since the battery has three cells,
that gives a desired voltage of 6.9V.</p>

<p> <i>Plug in your battery.</i> It is charging now. I'm not sure how
long it will take to charge. I didn't time the initial charge of my 5
amp-hour battery. I put the finishing touches on my charger about 9pm
and monitered the initial inrush of current. I left it still charging
when I went to bed, and when I woke up it was done. So probably your
battery will charge up overnight (10 hours?) as well.</p>

<p> <i>How to reassure yourself that it's working.</i> The best way to
check that the circuit is working is to monitor the current as it
flows into your battery. Recall that all the current goes through
resistor R3. So you can get a good estimate of the current going into
your battery by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor. Use
the formula I = V / R (where I = current in amps, V = voltage in
volts, R = resistance in ohms) to get the current flowing through
the resistor (since you know R3's resistance).</p>

<p> Initially, if your battey is discharged, the maximum current
(Imax, as described above) should be flowing through R3, and your
voltage drop should be .45 volts. As the battery fills up, the voltage
(and hence current) will drop, until eventually the calculation gives
you only a few tens of milliamps flowing into the battery. </p>

<h3>Diode protection for the L200 regulator?</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> If you leave your battery connected to the charger but unplug the
AC/DC converter that provides the power, you end up with the input
voltage of the circuit disconnected while the output voltage is still
present. Some regulators can be damaged by this, and thus diodes are
put into the circuit to protect them. However, my electronics expert,
Simon, says that this is highly unlikely as the L200 is a very robust
chip, and you shouldn't worry about this. In fact I left the battery
plugged into the charger without plugging in the AC/DC converter for a
couple of hours, and it didn't seem to harm the charger; it works just
the same now as before. </p>
