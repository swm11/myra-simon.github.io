<h1>What kind of bike do you need?</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This article represents my thoughts after many years of riding all
kinds of bikes. Sometimes the kind of bikes I recommend for a given
purpose aren't exactly what you might expect, but I give my reasons. I
don't cover specialist bikes like tandems, trikes, recumbents, or
folding bikes. </p>

<p> For each type of use I'll suggest a type of bike, or several types
of bike, and give you the rundown on them in terms of gearing, comfort
and what you can put on them (provision for mudguards, racks,
etc). </p>

<p> Also, I'll mention appropriate models for women. Women often have
trouble finding bikes that fit. This is because, first, they are
smaller than men, so sometimes they have difficulties finding bikes
they can get their legs over. Second, even if the top tube is at the
right height, it is often too long, meaning that the woman has to lean
too far forward and put too much weight on her hands as she rides. A
few custom builders seem to specialize in women's bikes. They are <a
href="http://www.donohuecycles.co.uk/">Paul Donohue</a>, 
<a href="http://www.longstaffcycles.co.uk/">
George Longstaff</a>, and Chas Roberts (0181 684 3370).
</p>

<p> Comfort is mostly due to riding position and the ability of the
bike to absorb shock. The saddle plays a significant part in it, but
since this is a very individual thing, I won't comment on it here.
Generally, a more upright position will be more comfortable than a
position where your back is close to being horizontal since the
upright position will put less stress on your shoulders, arms, hands,
etc. However, the more upright you are, the more wind resistance you
have, so you go slower for the same effort. A very important decision you
need to make is how much you're willing to trade off speed for
comfort. In general, dropped handlebars give you a lower, more
stretched out position that straight handlebars, or bars with upward
curves in the bars, although this is not always the case. </p>

<p> Shock absorption is affected by quite a few factors, including
frame and fork design and materials, width and pressure of tires, and
suspension (like suspension forks & seatposts). Generally, the wider
and lower pressure your tires, the more shock they will absorb, but the
tradeoff is that they will be heavier. </p>

<p> First, let's consider <b>off-road riding</b>. Off-road comes in
many flavors, but it basically boils down to smooth or rough. By
smooth I mean things like specially built cinder-surfaced paths like
canal paths, and reasonably smooth tracks and bridleways. Usually the
gradients aren't too steep on these paths. To be honest, just about
any bike can handle this, including old three speeds, folding bikes,
hybrids, city bikes, and touring bikes. Rough off-road can have any
number of obstacles, like logs, big rocks, dropoffs, steps, stream
crossings, loose stones, deep mud, or very steep gradients. If this is
your kind of off-road, you really need a mountain bike (MTB). Only the
low gears and fat knobby tires will take you where you want to go. If
you're a beginner and want to get into rough off-road riding, I would
suggest getting a decent quality MTB with front suspension (ie
suspension forks). I would avoid rear suspension, because unless you
pay quite a bit of money, you will only get an overly-heavy bike with
rear suspension that works very poorly. These cheap full-suspension
bikes are only good for looking cool, and are not well suited to
either on or off-road riding. </p>

<p> MTBs have plenty of other uses besides off-road riding. A rigid
(with no front suspension) mountain bike can easily be adapted for a
wide variety of on-road duties, so I'll be coming back to them again
later. </p>

<p> If your main interest is <b>going fast</b> on the road, either for
racing or fitness training, you want a racing-type bike. Many people
call these bikes "road bikes", but I think it's a bit of an odd name,
since all bikes can be used on the road.  Racing bikes have dropped
(curved) handlebars, reasonably fast handing (turning more quickly and
easily than other types of bike), and light weight. The handlebars are
usually set low and far away to give an aerodynamic position, although
this can be altered to meet the needs of the rider by changing
stems. </p>

<p> The gearing is high: the true racing bikes have two big chainrings
(say 42 and 52) while road bikes that are more for fitness and training 
will often come with a triple chainset to make steep hills easier. The
back sprockets offer closely spaced jumps over a small range (often 12
to 23 teeth). The better racing bikes have frames that absorb shock
reasonably well, through the use of things like thin-walled frame
tubes and carbon fiber forks. However they have skinny (about 23mm)
high pressure tires, so the tires don't absorb all that much
shock. They usually don't allow you to attach things like racks or
mudguards (fenders). </p>

<p> Women often too feel too stretched out on racing bikes. To race
and train you need to be moderately comfortable; being aero isn't
everything. Some companies have come out with racing bikes that suit
women very well. They are made from smaller (650c) wheels and have
much shorter top tubes than standard men's bike. Check out the <a
href="http://www.trekbikes.com/">Trek</a> WSD road bikes, <a
href="http://www.cannondale.com/">Cannondale</a> Compact road bikes,
and the <a href="http://www.orbit-cycles.co.uk/">Orbit</a> Mercury
Race, or talk to Donohue or Roberts for custom racers. In addition, <a
href="http://www.deesidecycles.com/">Deeside Cycles</a> have road
bikes made from standard 700c wheels with quite short top tubes. You
can also get them custom made with 650c wheels for an additional
fee. </p>

<p> If you want to want to go <b>moderately fast for long
distances</b>, but want to use mudguards (fenders) and carry light
luggage, consider an Audax or fast touring bike. They are named after
<a href="http://www.audax.uk.com/">Audax events</a>,
which are long-distance organized rides. These bikes usually come with
mudguards, and you can easily fit a rear rack on them. They are great
for day rides, or for credit-card touring. Since Audax bikes appeal to
a specialist audience, they are usually on the expensive side and are
of excellent quality. They have shock-absorbing frames and take bigger
tires than racing bikes, so they'll offer a somewhat smoother ride
than a racing bike. They are also usually set up in a less aero (more
upright) position for long-distance comfort. Since Audax events are
often hilly and long, they have lower gearing than racing bikes, using
a triple chainset. </p>

<p> Women interested in Audax bikes should check out <a
href="http://www.sjscycles.com/">Thorn</a> bikes. The smallest sizes
of the Audax are built around MTB wheels and have reasonably short top
tubes, and the XTC is one of their excellent selection of 26" wheeled
solo bikes. Or you could find out what Roberts recommends.  </p>

<p> Now I consider general purpose bikes, or <b>touring/leisure</b>
bikes. These bikes are used mostly for road riding, but can handle
smooth off-road riding as well, so they have fatter tires than the
above bikes. You can fit racks and mudguards on them, and they often
come equipped with them. They are designed with varying degrees of
upright posture, from a bit more upright than racing, to bolt
upright. </p>

<p> A traditional touring bike has 700c wheels and dropped bars. The
bars are usually set reasonably high so the rider isn't stooped over
too far, however many people still find themselves too stretched out
on a touring bike. Touring bikes have a long wheelbase (distance
between the centers of the two wheels) for a steady ride over long
distances and heel clearance for bags on the rear rack. Most have
cantilever brakes, which provide clearance for wide tires as well as
mudguards. They have triple chainrings and often use non-compact
mountain bike chainsets (i.e. largest chainring 46 or 48 teeth).
Their rear cogsets have a big range of cog sizes (usually 11 to 28)
with a bigger gap between cog sizes than on racers. They are usually
not very cheap, but they are quite strong and will last a lifetime if
treated well. </p>

<p> Now there are some touring bikes with 26" mountain bike wheels,
such as the Dawes 1. Down, the Roberts Rough Stuff, the <a
href="http://www.orbit-cycles.co.uk/">Orbit</a> Romany, and
the <a href="http://www.sjscycles.com/">Thorn</a> Nomad, XTC, or
EXP. Some of these, especially the Roberts Rough Stuff, the Orbit
Mercury, and all of the Thorns can be bought with short top tubes to
suit women and other small riders who want a more upright
position. </p>

<p> I wouldn't recommend a bike with dropped bars to a beginner.  I
feel that straight handlebars, which put your shifters and brakes
within easy reach, and give you a (usually) more upright position than
dropped bars, are more beginner friendly (although less aerodynamic
and therefore slower) than bikes with dropped bars. Some people argue
that bikes with straight bars aren't nearly as comfortable as bike
with drop bars because the straight bars only allow you one hand
position. This is true, but the simple addition of bars ends (things
you attach to the ends of your handlebars that point forward) give you
a good variety of hand positions and allow you to stretch out a bit to
get a little bit more aerodynamic. Bar ends with a curve or sharp bend
in them offer even more options for hand positioning. </p>

<p> A hybrid bike has 700c wheels and handlebars that are either
straight or have a slight curve to bring the hand position
higher. They have mountain-bike style shifting and brake levers, which
are easily accessible from the standard hand placement, and so are
very beginner-friendly. They usually have MTB-style V-brakes, which
stop you quickly and usually have room to fit mudguards. Your typical
hybrid looks like the Dawes Discovery bike pictured. You can get
hybrids that are specialized from here. Some are more like mountain
bikes with 700c wheels: they have somewhat knobbly tires and
suspension forks. (In my opinion, you shouldn't buy a hybrid with a
suspension fork. If you're riding off-road that rough, just buy a
mountain bike.) Some are specialized more towards fast riding by
having very smooth tires, low handlebars, and faster turning, more
like that of a racing bike. Unless you get a one of these fairly
specialized ones, a hybrid is a good general-purpose bike, suitable
for riding to work, going out on country lanes for fun and exercise,
and riding along reasonably smooth off-road tracks. The better ones
are fairly light and quite tough and can even be used for loaded
touring, if you add racks and mudguards. </p>

<p> Women who are sufficiently tall to straddle the top tubes on these
bikes usually get on with them, since the handlebars are (usually)
reasonably high and close to the saddle. At the worst they might
require a stem change (see <a href="bodge.html">Bodge your bike to
fit</a>).  Women who are too short should look to mountain bikes
instead. </p>

<p> If you decide to go for one of these, there are several things you
can do to make them better for longer road riding. If you end up
getting one of the pseudo MTBs, it would be a good idea to swap the
somewhat knobby tires they come with for smoother tires. If it's
possible, you should put bar ends on the bike to allow for a change of
hand position. </p>

<p> Finally, we come back to mountain bikes. Many people discount them
as possiblilities for touring/leisure use, thinking that they are
heavy and slow. Well, if you buy a cheap department store MTB, it will
be heavy, but in fact MTBs with good quality light frames are
relatively inexpensive. It's the volume of sales at work for you
here. Knobbly MTB tires are certainly slow and heavy, but if you swap
them for some narrower slick tires (such as 1.5" Specialized Nimbus or
Schwalbe Marathon) you'll get a tire that rivals any touring bike tire
for low weight and rolling resistance. The only way in which MTBs are
slow is that they have low gearing: the biggest chainring is usually
42 teeth. Unless you can pedal exceptionally quickly, this limits your
top pedaling speed to something like 25mph (of course you can coast
much faster!). If you don't think you'll be wanting to pedal your bike
faster than this, there's no reason to avoid a mountain bike. </p>

<p> If you want a MTB for general-purpose use, rather than rough
off-road riding, then I suggest that you get a MTB without a
suspension fork. Unfortunately they can be hard to find: the industry
would have you believe that if you're going over anything rougher than
glass-smooth tarmac you need suspension forks. Not so: the fatter
tires of an MTB (even the smooth 1.5" tires I have recommended)
suffice plenty well on roughly-paved roads and smoothish off-road,
such as gravel-surfaced tracks. For general-purpose riding, a
suspension fork is a liability, not an asset. It adds weight, expense,
and complexity: it's yet another thing that can go wrong on your
bike. It also adds to the desirability of the bike for thieves. Make
the effort to find a good quality MTB with a rigid fork. Go for a fork
made out of cromoly steel. Avoid high-tensile steel as this is the
lowest quality bike frame material and is overly heavy. </p>

<p> Women are usually reasonably well-served by MTBs, as they have low
top tubes and can be fitted with short stems to bring the handlebars
close enough. However, there is still quite a range of top tube
lengths, and women who are having a hard time finding a suitable bike
may consider a women-specific bike like the Trek WSD models. </p>

<p> Many midrange mountain bike have all the fittings you'd need to
attach racks and mudguards.  The more sporty MTBs have bars that are
pretty low and far from the saddle, but with a change of stem (see <a
href="bodge.html">Bodge your bike to fit</a>) the bars can be brought
much higher and closer to you to put you more upright. You can get the
tires swapped for slicks to give you much less rolling resistance. The
brakes are V-brakes, which have great stopping power. Because mountain
bikes are so popular, they are often very good value for money. Using
a mountain bike as a general purpose touring/leisure bike is often a
very good solution for smaller people and women. See <a
href="women-tour.html">An inexpensive touring/leisure bike</a> for
info on what to look for. Also see <a href="mtb-advice1.html"> A
beginner's guide to buying a mountain bike</a> for advice on finding
one that fits. </p>
