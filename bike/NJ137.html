<h1>A long ride in New Jersey</h1>

<p> On Sunday (Oct 29, 1995) I went for a long ride. There were two goals
for this ride.  One was to do try out a route for the ride Jack Fisher
and I are leading Thanksgiving Sunday, and the other was to more or
less redo a ride I'd done last July. That ride was the first really
long ride I'd done, and my second longest overall (only beaten by the
double century Taylor and I did last August). The basic route was:
start in Philly, cross the Delaware via Ben Franklin Bridge to Camden,
go southeast to the shore (actually the Forsythe Wildlife Refuge just
north of Atlantic City), head north and a bit west to go thru' the
Pine Barrens, then northwest back to Camden, and then back to
Philly. That ride ended up being 137 miles long, and it was really
nice, except for the part getting out of Camden.</p>

<p> In order to use the ride to test out the bike club ride, I altered the
route a bit so that the first part and last part would form roughly a
70-mile loop from Philly. I plotted my route using three maps: the
Delaware Valley Bike Commuters Map, for picking out good bike roads up
to about 10 miles into Camden County, a Camden County map, and a map
of Southern NJ. I felt that the Southern NJ map would suffice for the
other counties I'd be going thru' (Atlantic & Burlington) since once
you get out of Camden County, if you avoid the populated areas (like
Atlantic City), there are very few roads that aren't on the Southern
NJ map.</p>

<p> I headed out Sunday morning at 7am, and went over the BF Bridge on the
north sidewalk, which I haven't done for a long time. I vaguely
remember going over the north side once before, maybe four years ago,
with a friend. That was back in the days when I'd let other people
plot the routes, and I'd just come along for the ride... It seems to
me that the narrow section on the north side is even narrower than the
narrow section on the south side, but maybe my memory is impaired.</p>

<p> The trip thru' Camden was much better than on my previous year's ride,
since I was using better maps. Last year I'd plotted the route with a
Philly 50-mile radius map, which had no details in Camden.  This time
I avoided the big roads as much as possible and went along the Cooper
River Park. On my Camden County map I'd spotted a long, un-numbered
road called Cooper Rd that looked promising. Basically, all roads of
any consequance in Southern NJ have numbers, like 5XX, 6XX, 7XX.
Usually only short streets in towns don't have numbers, so this made
Cooper stick out. I followed suggestions of the Bike Commuters Map
for getting from the Cooper River to Cooper Rd. Riding along the
roads, I was pleasantly surprised to find them posted with "bike
route" signs, and I recognized some of them from an MS-150 City to
Shore Ride I did one year. Cool! Getting to Cooper Rd, I found that it
was just great. I didn't expect such a lightly-travelled (and even
lightly-populated) road so close to Camden!</p>

<p> When Cooper Road ended I worked my way over to 536, which heads into
the Pine Barrens. I took this until it ended at 206 -- another nice
collection of roads. I saw something along 536 that I've never seen
before -- it was a group of game birds crossing the road. I wasn't
exactly sure what they were. They're the kind of things you see in
those old paintings of hunters in breeches and tall hats with happy
dogs bouncing at their heels, coming back to camp after a good day in
the woods. I'm pretty sure I've never seen those things in the wild
before, so it was a nice sighting. (Back at home I looked it up in my
field guide: they're ruffed grouse, a popular game bird, and very
common in the Pine Barrens.)</p>

<p> From 206 I departed to make a big loop to the shore. I headed south to
pick up 561, and then took that and 561 alternate to Leeds Point, in
the wildlife refuge. I was on these two roads for about 23 miles. This
is not a long time to be on the same road in a car, but in my riding
around Philly, I'm very rarely on one road for more than 5 miles, so
this seemed very long. Not to mention that the scenery along this road
is quite uniform -- pines, pines, pines, and more pines, and the thing
goes perfectly straight and is almost completely flat. Gads! Riding in
Southern NJ requires alot of patience, just pedalling on and on,
waiting until you get to where you're going. At least I had a nice
tailwind to speed me on my way, so it took less time than it would
usually.</p>

<p> Route 561 alt ended in the Forsythe Wildlife Refuge. This refuge, like
Tinicum in Philly, is a collection of wetlands that seems to be set
aside mostly for birds. Upon arrival I was rewarded by the sight of a
great blue heron flying very close by, probably startled by my
arrival. I took off some clothes (jacket, toe warmers), ate some food,
and then headed back. After seeing "SOUTH 561" on the signs for so
long, I was happy to see them now say "NORTH 561".  At least, I was
initially happy about this change. My happiness drained away when I
realized that the tailwind which had sped me to the shore was now a
nasty headwind. This was not going to be a pleasant trip back...</p>

<p> I stopped at Smithville for supplies. I carried all the food that I
would need, but I felt that I deserved a treat. Smithville seems to
have two parts. One is an ugly housing development. The other
("Historic Smithville") is a small collection of shops: produce,
antiques, crafts, etc. There's a bakery there, and I stopped to fill
up my water bottles and get a muffin and a brownie. My biking clothes
were obvious, and one patron commented that I was refueling.</p>

<p> From Smithville I took a varied collections of roads to get back to
206. All of these roads were nice, and the trip would have been quite
enjoyable except for the constant headwind. I got back to 206,
rejoining my tentative bike club route, and headed north. Altho' 206
is a biggish road, it's fine for biking, since it has a very wide,
smooth, clean shoulder, so you can go along without bothering the
cars. Still, despite being safe, it's not very pleasant: too much
traffic. Route 563, further east, is fantastic, and it's what I took
last July, but it's too far from Philly to be accessible on a 70-mile
ride.  I'll have to see if I can find a way around 206. The problem is
that there are very few roads thru' the Pine Barrens, and most of the
ones that are on the map either don't exist or are dirt (sand, really)
and are completely impassable by bike.  Well, I'll do some more
scouting, and I'm sure I can find some collection of roads that will
minimize the time spent on 206.</p>

<p> I had to push to keep moving against the headwind. Sometimes it was
strong enough that I had to work hard to go anything over 10mph. I
stopped at a restaurant on 206 for water, and the lady behind the
counter commented that I looked tired: I was breathing pretty heavy
and looked rather worn out. She said "I hope you don't have too far to
go". I said "Unfortunately I do". I didn't feel like mentioning that I
had to get back to Philly. It was too depressing...</p>

<p> At this point I began to have fantasies of someone with a pickup truck
or van or other vehicle with bike-carrying capacity pulling over,
saying "Gosh, you look tired, would you like a ride?" No one did, of
course. I was still moving, so I guess I looked like I was doing fine.
My bottom was also getting a bit sore, and I thought nice thoughts of
being home, wearing some loose sweatclothes, drinking hot herbal tea
with honey.  After not too long, the sweats idea was replaced by the
warm fuzzy flannel sheets on my bed... I thought of the phone card in
my rack bag, and of my boyfriend, hanging around home, with the car
nearby. I could stop at a phone booth to ask him to come get me. But,
no, I was still moving, I may as well keep going.</p>

<p> I began to wonder: why am I doing this? Why the heck do I do these
long rides? What am I trying to prove?  What's the point of this? My
trip last July wasn't nearly so bad: it was the headwinds on this trip
that was doing it. I'd forgotten how demoralizing steady headwinds can
be. While touring in Oregon in 1990 I called it quits after 30 miles
on one particularly windy day.  And my average for the trip was 60
miles/day, so that was a really wimpy move.</p>

<p> After leaving 206 I went on 541, another highway that goes on forever.
Twice along the route I began to wonder if I'd gotten confused and
missed my turn, and I stopped to check my maps, only to find that the
road I'd just crossed was still well away from the one I needed.
Once, I heard a noise in the back of the bike, and then the back wheel
froze. I skidded, but managed to keep the bike upright, and also
somehow managed to get my foot off the pedal before I came to a
complete stop. Luckily I wasn't going very fast, or else I think I'd
have been much more likely to fall. I checked out the bike: a wire
(like what coat hangers are made out of) had done the damage. One end
of it had gotten hung up on the straddle cable for my rear brakes, and
the other had grabbed a spoke!  I freed the wire, and happily, the
wheel seemed fine, despite being stopped dead by force on one spoke. A
well-made wheel! I went on...</p>

<p> It got very cloudy.  But I wasn't worried, there wasn't any rain
predicted. And then I felt the raindrops. I began to curse the
weatherman. But it was a very light rain, and I didn't even get wet.
I began to wish I'd brought clear glasses with me: I don't like to
leave my eyes unprotected as I ride, so I always wear clear glasses at
night and on dark days like this was getting to be. But I thought it
would be sunny, and I'd get back before dark, so I only brought
sunglasses. Oh, well, something to remember for next time...</p>

<p> Finally, after being on 541 for what seeme like forever, the turn
came: 616, Church Rd. From here on, I knew all the turns, having been
here a couple of times before, and my spirits picked up dramatically.
The headwinds were still there, but I was in the home stretch -- only
about 20 miles back to Camden. I pedalled on...</p>

<p> From Church Road I went to 537, which heads straight into Camden. As I
got close to Camden night was falling. I took off my sunglasses, still
wishing for the clear glasses, and turned on the Vistalight that lives
on my rack. I've got reflective stuff all over my helmet and bike, so
I felt reasonably safe, but I still wished I'd had a headlight to be
more visible from the front. I think I'll get one of those front
Vistalights. They're not great, but they'd be much better than nothing
if I'm caught in the dark without a proper headlight.</p>

<p> I got into Camden and was at the base of the bridge at about 5:35. I
was extremely tired. I contemplated walking thru' the narrow section,
not being sure that I had the energy to keep the thing going straight
on that narrow area, up the slope of the bridge. But walking would
take longer, so I tried riding. Using lots of concentration, I
succeeded. Then I was out of the narrow section and was safe. I
pedalled on. And on. Suddenly, the thought occurred me: now, just how
wide <i>is</i> the Delaware, anyway? I seemed to have been on the bridge
for quite some time. Of course I wasn't moving very fast. But by that
time I was at the halfway point, and then I started going downhill,
and the rest of the bridge want by quickly.</p>

<p> I rode back along Walnut, going awfully slowly, about 10mph. I was
beat. I finally arrived home and checked my trip meter: 137 miles,
just the same as my ride last July. Oh, well. I was too tired to
contemplate going out for a bit more to bring it up to something like
140. I barely had the energy to carry my bike upstairs.</p>

<p> My boyfriend was watching TV when I got back. He said "I guess you want
to take a shower". I said "No, this is what I want to do" and I
stretched out, still wearing my jacket and gloves, on the nice soft
carpet, and enjoyed the feeling of not moving. Home at last!</p>
