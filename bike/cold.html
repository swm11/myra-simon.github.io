<h2>Cold Weather Riding</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> This is a long article about riding in very cold (like freezing or
below) weather.</p>

<p> The first thing I should say is: the most important thing is to
keep <b>all</b> parts of your body warm. Usually when we're outside,
we put on a thick jacket, maybe a hat, and we can either put on gloves
or put our hands in our pockets, and we're fine for walking to
classes or work. We don't worry about our legs or face, and our
regular shoes are usually fine for our feet. When you go out riding,
you find three things: (1) what you wear on your chest (the thick
jacket) is too heavy, and you end up sweating like crazy, (2) what you
wear on the rest of body is insufficient, and (3) since you're really
exposed to the air, keeping the wind off you becomes very
important.</p>

<p> What you need to aim for is a more-or-less uniform covering of
yourself, top to bottom. You should have about the same thickness of
stuff on you all over.</p>

<p> <b>Materials</b>: you basically need two types of fabrics. The
first type of stuff is for warmth, the second to block the wind. For
warmth, use polypro or any one of its cousins (thermax, caprilene,
etc), polyester fleece, or wool. Silk used to be the thing, but I
think that wool is warmer, and artificial fibers wick better, and silk
is expensive. But if you have it already, you can use it. Cotton is
not good. It soaks up water, stops insulating, and starts to feel
really disgusting. To keep the wind off you, simple non-stretchy nylon
is all you need. You can get fancier fabrics (Gore-Tex, Silmond
microfiber, etc), but the only real difference is weight of fabic and
water-restistance. It all works pretty much the same for protecting
you from wind.</p>

<p> So, starting at the top, here are my specific recommendations.</p>

helmet cover (not cold enough for hood), Activent jacket with pit
zips, long-fingered gloves, padded tights, Shimano winter
boots. </i></td></tr>

</table>  

<p> <b>Head</b>: One fellow I know phrased it this way: "no balaclava,
no ride".  A balaclava is a piece of stretchy fabric that goes over your
head, with a big hole for your face. It covers your neck, chin, and
the sides, back, and top of head. If you want, you can pull it over
your mouth as well. You may want even more than a balaclava. I have a
Gore-Tex helmet cover. It stretches over your helmet and blocks the
wind from blowing through your vents, thus holding in whatever heat
escapes from your balaclava. The nice thing about the helmet cover is
that it's another layer you can add that doesn't have to be crammed
under your helmet. The helmet cover (about $15) is not essential; I
was out riding in below freezing weather before I got it, but it does
help. The balaclava is essential for weather much below freezing. </p>

<p> However, I haven't actually used my balaclava since moving to the
UK. Instead I have some bike jerseys that have thin hoods
attached. The hoods cover my neck and my entire head. They are thin
enough to fit under a helmet without fiddling with the pads, and the
fact that they are attached to my jersey means that they don't move
around, and if it warms up I can just push it off without worrying
about putting it into a pocket. These jerseys come from Performance
and are about the only jerseys I wear in winter. I still use a
Gore-Tex helemt cover pretty much non-stop from October to April. </p>

<p> <b>Eyes</b>: They will dry out extremely fast if you don't wear
something over them. If you wear glasses this is often enough, but if
it's very windy or you're descending alot, the wind can make your eyes
water and make it difficult to see where you're going. Consider
cycle-specific glasses. If you don't wear glasses, make sure you put
something on your eyes. If you don't like sunglasses, get something
clear.</p>

<p> <b>Upper Body</b>: lots of thin warm layers, with wind protection
on top. I find that I generally need a bit more on my torso than on my
arms. If you have a fleece vest this comes in handy as one of the
layers. Or wear a wicking T-shirt or short-sleeve jersey as your base
layer. You need a layer of windproof nylon on your chest (at
least). This can come in the form of a vest, a cycling
jacket with nylon on the front and insulating material elsewhere (a
<i>very</i> useful cold-weather riding accessory), or a plain nylon
jacket. There's no need to go for the multi-bucks approach here.</p>

<p> A very useful feature on a jacket for cold weather riding is pit
zips. These allow you to adjust the amount of wind cooling you get,
preventing you from overheating when you're working hard, but allowing
you to keep out all drafts when you're not working so hard or it cools
off in the evenings. My favorite fabric for cold-weather riding is
Activent. It transmits moisture well, is semi-waterproof, completely
windproof, and very light. I used to wear Gore-Tex alot for riding,
but I find it too heavy and hot for winter riding in Britain. </p>

<p> <b>Hands</b>: warm windproof gloves. They don't have to be special
cycling gloves. I have super-thick REI Gore-Tex ski gloves for
extremely cold weather. As long as I keep moving, my hands don't get
cold. However, they can get too warm and sweaty, so it's useful to have
a range of thicknesses of gloves so you can select the gloves
appropriate for the temperature. </p>

<p> <b>Legs</b>: again, several warm layers. If it's really cold
(significantly below freezing) you'll want wind protection on top. You
can get tights that have a wind-stopping layer in front, and these are
great. If you don't have this, nylon pants over a couple pairs of
tights are fine.</p>

<p> One item of clothing I've found very useful for winter riding are
long tights with pads in them. This prevents the buildup of layers
around your bum and belly, which some people (like me) find binding. I
have several pairs of Performance polypro tights with pads. They are
mid-weight, have a brushed inside and a good quality pad, and are very
comfy. Now when I go out for winter riding, my only thoughts are: is
it warm enough to wear my padded tights alone, or do I put a thin pair
of unpadded tights on top? </p>

<p> <b>Feet</b>: again, several warm layers with wind protection on
top. One approach is one or two layers of socks, then cycle shoes,
then something on top of that. If you wear two layers of socks, make
sure one of them is very thin, perhaps polypro sock liners, or perhaps
Gore-tex socks. Fleece socks (mine are made by Acorn) make a very good
(warm and dry) insulating layer. Shoes without mesh are best for
warmth in the winter. For the top, you can use neoprene booties.  An
additional aid you can use if it's really cold and you've got room in
your shoes are chemical heater packs.  </p>

<p> An alternative to all this is to get winter specific cycling
shoes. I use Shimano D100 boots. They aren't made anymore, but the
current W100 are even better. These are solid waxy leather, like
hiking boots use, and they keep the wind completely off your feet, and
do a very good job of shedding rain and insulating your feet as
well. Wearing just some warm hiking socks underneath I'm comfy for
rides of several hours in temperatures a bit below freezing. </p>
