<h1> Review of <i>Zinn and the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance</i> </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Let me be honest with you. I really like Lennard Zinn's <i>Zinn and
the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance</i>. It covers just about
everything you need to know about caring for your mountain bike. All
procedures are described in a clear way, and there are plenty of
illustrations to show you what to do. It's a valuable reference for
all mountain bikers. </p>

<p> The title of the book is a play on <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance</i>, which obviously inspired Zinn. He quotes from it at
the beginning of the book as he tries to convey his deep pleasure
in fixing mountain bikes. He goes on to write 
<blockquote>The step-by-step procedures in this book, coupled with the
exploded diagrams are so simple to follow that even the pure romantic
can discover a passion for spreading new grease on old parts. The
romantic can also appreciate how success at bike mechanics requires
that the procedures are done with a certain sense of love. If not,
frustration will take over, and all the care you imagined putting into
your mountain bike will be lost, along with the joy of
riding.</blockquote> 
Ah, almost poetry, that. I couldn't agree more. </p>

<p> The book is very approachable. The writing is casual and
conversational. You can almost hear Lennard talking to you as you're
working. "Spin the hub while holding the axle, and turn the axle while
holding the hub. Does it turn roughly? Is the axle bent or broken?
Wobble the axle from side to side. Is the bearing adjustment loose?" To
make sure you don't get too bored with all this bike talk, he throws
in little jokes.  For example, he mentions Beryllium as an exotic
material used by framebuilders. "A few folks have tried building bikes
out of the stuff. It works great, but has the drawback of being
poisonous if ingested or inhaled; therefore I strongly recommend
against trying to taste or snort a Beryllium frame." </p>

<p> The illustrations are copious. They are hand-drawn and very clear.
They allow you to see what's going on much better than photos would.
Some people think that this gives a retro feel to the book: it seems
that nowadays heaps of color glossy photos are almost a requirement
for bike books. But Zinn has chosen clarity and simplicity over being
trendy. I approve. </p>

<p> The book is quite comprehensive. It covers all parts of your bike,
explaining procedures as simple as patching a punctured tube to as
advanced as replacing a headset. Each major bike part has its own
section, which covers almost all varieties of the part and has a
troubleshooting guide to help you out when things go wrong. In
addition, there is a useful and important chapter on emergency repairs
(with several fixes suggested, depending on what tools you have) and
trail safety. </p>

<p> In summary, this fine book is an invaluable reference for how to keep
your bike in top working order as well as being fun to flip
through. </p>
