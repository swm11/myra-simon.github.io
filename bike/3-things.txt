  Hiya Folks-

  Here are three bike-related things I'll tell you about. I'll go
  chronologically backwards, to get the shortest things first.

  (1) On Sunday I lead the spin-off ride again. We'll meet the usual
  time and place (12:15 at the rock near the Italian Fountain back of
  the Art Museum), and we'll go thru' Ridley Creek State Park and
  Swarthmore. We'll stop at a Wawa a few miles from the park to buy
  lunch (and refill water bottles), and then we'll carry it into the
  park. We'll eat it at the park office, where there is lots of shade
  (and rest rooms). Then we'll proceed out of the park, following Ridley
  Creek, and work our way over to Swarthmore. We'll go thru' Swarthmore
  campus, and stop in the village of Swarthmore to gt more water, and
  from there we'll head back to Philly. This will be about 40 miles
  long. There will be some hills out towards Ridley Creek State Park.
  Again, we'll go at a relaxed C pace.

  (2) Yesterday I did the Fairmount Park Classic Triathalon. Well, I
  didn't participate in it (I'm pretty bad at running and swimming), but
  I volunteered for it. The Quaker City Wheelmen was recruited by the
  organizer of the triathalon to help out with the biking section of the
  course. Kevin Girard, a recent QCW member, took over the task of
  organizing us. He did an amazing job...  We met at 6:30 am (yeeek!) at
  Memorial Hall, and Kevin soon showed up to send us in our separate
  directions. I went to the water stop on the hill between the Sweet
  Briar Cutoff and the Smith Memorial. The bikers would be coming up
  this hill, thus going slower than usual, so passing them water,
  Gatorade, and Power Bars would be easier. We had a hose (hooked up to
  a fire hydrant), four large plastic garbage pails, some dish soap, a
  table, lots of big pouches of Gatorade, a few bags of ice, and about
  1000 green water bottles with the Gatorade logo.

  When we got there we washed the water bottles, mixed Gatorade, and
  transported filled bottles to the people on the street who'd be
  passing them out. All was relaxed and enjoyable, until the bikers
  started coming... They soon deplated our stocks, and then we were
  racing to collect bottles (they tossed out the empty bottles as they
  collected full ones), rinse them out (we abandoned washing them with
  soap pretty quickly, since it took too much time and water to get the
  suds out of the bottles), mix up Gatorade (this took a while since we
  mixed it up a garbage can at a time, and it took a long time to fill a
  garbage can with water), and fill the bottles with water and Gatorade.
  We had to sort out the water bottles, because many of the bottles that
  people tossed out had the little straps that attach the lid to the
  bottle broken, or had screw on lids, which meant that we couldn't
  treat them in an assembly line way, since the lid would get separated
  from the bottle in the process.

  When the biking section was over, we just stayed on and passed out
  stuff to the runners. There were water stations especially for the
  runners, but they didn't have a hose, so they'd often come down to our
  station and borrow the hose for awhile to fill their jugs. Also they
  ran out of paper cups and didn't have spare water to rinse them. Our
  "headless water bottles" (water bottles with separated lids) came in
  really handy here: runners didn't care whether there are lids or
  not. When our hose wasn't in use filling garbage cans and bottles, we
  sprayed the passing runners, who really appreciated it.

  During the entire thing we were enjoying the sight of these nicely
  muscular, scantily clad bodies passing by. I think the women got more
  of a treat than the guys did, since there were more male triathaloners
  than female, but there were enough women to keep the guys happy as
  well.

  All in all, it was a fun morning. I left at around 1pm, when the
  runners had thinned out, and went home to take a shower. When we left
  we were invited to take all the water bottles we wanted to. There was
  quite a variety of them, since the people had started with their
  own bottles at the beginning of the ride. We also got T-shirts.  There
  was a dinner was at 3pm, that I could have gone to as a volunteer, but
  I found that when I got home I just wanted to relax and sleep.

  (3) Wednesday thru' Saturday last week I was "up home", in upstate NY,
  near Binghamton (about 200 miles north of here, just north of the
  NY-PA border). My Mom had rented a cabin in the local state park
  (Chenango Valley) for that week, and I welcomed that chance to get
  away somewhere cool, green, and quiet. Despite being not very far from
  Philly, it is always noticably cooler there than here, which is not so
  great in winter, but very pleasant at this time of year.

  On Friday I went for a 66 mile ride that I found satisfying in many
  ways. One was that it was the first time I met in person a fellow I'd
  corresponded with for a few months. You folks on this mailing list may
  recall a message in March by a fellow named Marshall Lake, who was
  asking for route suggestions for a ride he and his nephew will be
  doing from Washington DC to Binghamton (they'll do this next week). I
  wrote back to him, and we've been trading email every now and then
  since then. It turned out that on Friday he was in town to attend a
  family reunion (his hometown is also Binghamton), and since I'd be
  there as well, we thought this would be a good opportunity to meet and
  go for a ride together.

  Despite having been into biking ever since I was a kid, I have not
  done all that much biking in my hometown. When I went riding I'd tend
  to stick to the areas I know, and I never got much out into the
  country.  On my trips back to visit my family I've done very little
  biking, only going out with my dad every now and then since he's
  gotten a nice bike. I'd never taken out a map and looked for what
  might be an interesting route, as I've done so much of recently for
  rides around Philly. Marshall left the plotting of the route we'd take
  to me, so this was my opportunity. I collected some of my family's
  maps and tried to figure out where I wanted to go. Immediately I saw
  that several of the places that I have fond memories of from my
  childhood years were not that far from the park, where we'd be
  starting. So I plotted a route that would cover them.

  I met Marshall in the parking lot of the park office 9am Friday, we
  made our introductions (there was no mistaking who we were, we were
  the only people there with bikes) and we headed out. It was a sunny
  day, and it seemed that it might get hot.

  The first stop was Cole Park, a county (Broome County) park that I'd
  been to many times as a kid. I'd spend hours swimming in the lake,
  paddling around in a rented canoe, playing on the wooden jungle gym
  (one of the first I'd seen), eating picnic food, watching the 4th of
  July fireworks. After a bit of reminiscing on my part, we filled our
  water bottles and headed on. Just after leaving I noticed that my tire
  looked a bit low on air, to we stopped for me to fill it up.

  The next destination was the road I lived on from ages 2 - 14. It was
  the first time I'd been there for ... gosh, probably close to 10
  years. I remembered the huge hills that I'd struggle up as a kid on my
  old, heavy one-speed, and I laughed. They were a peice of cake on my
  touring bike, with my adult muscles. I pointed out to Marshall the
  house of the friendly math teacher that I liked to visit with, the
  road with the daffodils at the end, the deep dark scary pine woods,
  the road that the lady who taught me to rollerskate lived on, the
  house of the people that had the exotic pets (a pair of moutain lions,
  an ocelot). And I saw my old house, the first trees I climbed, the
  fields I explored... Somehow everything looked smaller than I
  remembered.

  Then on to the north, following side roads (some of turned out to be
  unpaved) to the little village of Greene for lunch. Neither Marhshall
  nor I were very familiar with this town, so we didn't know where to
  eat. We chose a place that had a big window so we could watch the
  bikes as we ate (neither of us had locks). The prices there were
  astonishingly low: I got a $2 turkey sandwich (includes chips) and
  three lemonades... From there we headed west, then turned north on an
  unnamed road. It was unnamed on all my maps (except on one map it had
  a little 2 on it), but I figured that I'd find it because it was the
  first major road we crossed, and because it went to the town of
  Smithville Flats, so I thought there'd be a sign indicating this.
  Indeed, finding it was not a problem.

  Upon arriving in Smithville Flats we turned left (west) onto a little
  road called Round Pond Road. This road leads to the top end of Whitney
  Point Lake, a big (5 miles long) man-made lake that my family liked to
  camp at. This road went perfectly straight, ignoring the terrain,
  which was hilly. So we'd go up a moderately steep hill, get to the
  top, go down a steep hill (often getting above 40 mph), then repeat
  the process. This was getting annoying. Not to mention that it was
  getting pretty hot. We were making jokes along the lines of "you know
  it's hot when..." including "you know it's hot when the major sound as
  you ride is the bikes tires popping the tar bubbles on the road" and
  "you know it's hot when you welcome a headwind because it cools you
  down" (both of which happened to us).  Going up each hill, we began to
  think: maybe this one is the last one, then we'll be at the lake... I
  was better at hills than Marshall, so I'd get to the top, and then
  sadly report "Darn, yet another hill". Finally, I got to the top and
  said "I see another hill... but it's far away; I bet the lake is
  between us and it". And so we went down for a very long time and found
  the lake at the bottom.

  We pulled into Upper Lisle Campgroud, at the top of the lake, for a
  bathroom/refill water bottles/eat snack stop. Also I changed the
  tube in the rear tire, since it was getting low again. And then we
  headed off. We were getting tired with all the hills, and it was hot,
  so we abandoned most of my plotted route, which went along side roads
  (which often turned out to be dirt roads), instead taking route 79
  back to the little town of Chenango Forks, and a little road from
  there to the park. Back at the park office, Marshall and I shook hands
  and parted, he to meet his brother for dinner, and me to the cabin.

  I really enjoyed this trip. Partly this was because it gave me a
  chance to meet Marshall, but there was much more. Part of it was that
  the route I chose ended up being very nice. Hilly, but scenic. Part of
  it was that it gave me a better idea of my hometown -- for example, I
  hadn't realized there were so many dirt roads in Broome County! Part
  of it was seeing again places that had so much meaning for my
  childhood. Part of it was going to these places, for the first time
  ever, by bike. I also impressed my family and friends. When I
  described the route, and mentioned eating lunch in Greene, they'd say
  "Oh, and then you took 12 south back to the park, right?" and I'd say
  "Nope, we went on north and west to Whitney Point". There is a
  certain thrill about going someplace by bike that you've always been
  to by car. For example, last year I went on a bike club ride to the
  Pagoda in Reading. This ride started at a park not too far from
  Reading, but we still had to go up the mountain, and it gave me a great
  feeling of satisfaction to get to the top by my own muscle power,
  after going up so many times in a car. A couple years ago was the
  first time I plotted out and rode my route to Ridley Creek. I'd been
  there by car before, but it was especially satisfying to go there by
  bike, and I hope that those people who join me on Sunday's ride enjoy
  it as much as I do.
