<h1>Essential Accessories for the Beginning Cyclist</h1>

<h2>by Myra VanInwegen and <a href="http://www.5339.co.uk" title="Road

<blockquote>

<p>Cycling isn't just about exercise, but also about outings with
family and friends. It can also be a very good way of getting around:
of commuting to work every day or doing your weekly shop. With the
right accessories, you'll never find yourself unprepared on the
road.</p>

<p> Below is the list of the most important accessories the
beginning cyclist should consider buying to ensure both safety and
efficiency of his/her riding experience. Some of these are more relevant
to the utility cyclist (someone who rides short distances on a regular
basis to get to work or do shopping), while some are more relevant to
the cyclist who's riding for fun and fitness. I'll mention who
it's most relevant for in the blurbs below. </p>

<h3>Knowledge of how to ride safely</h3>

<p> If you ride in towns, you need to know how to ride safely in
traffic. This does not necessarily require a purchase, but if you want
to buy a book you can either get John Franklin's <i>Cyclecraft</i>
(more oriented towards UK riding) or John Forester's <i>Effective
Cycling</i> (more oriented towards the US). If you don't want to spend any
money you can read my article <a href="bike-saf.html">Bicycle
Safety</a>. If you are never riding in a town but are only riding on
empty country lanes or offroad tracks, then you will not need to be an
expert in riding in traffic, but it would be a good idea to have
a look at my article anyway, as these skills can help make trips
through villages safer. </p>

<h3>Something to carry stuff</h3>

<p> Everyone needs to carry things with them on a bike. If you're a
utility rider, the main options are rucksack (aka backpack) and
pannier. You've probably already got a rucksack, so no purchase is
necessary. If you do buy a rucksack for utility riding, look for one
that's brightly colored and has lots of reflective stuff on it to
increase your visibility both night and day. Or you can buy a rucksack
cover that's brightly colored and had lots of reflective stuff. Many
people don't like to have anything on their backs when they ride, so a
rack and panniers (bags that attach to racks with clips) are the way
to go there. The longer your rides, and the heavier the load, the more
important it is to get the weight off your back and onto the
bike. If you buy a rack for your commuter bike, make sure you get one
that has a light mounting plate on the back with holes 80mm apart, so
you can mount a good rear light to it.</p>

<p> If you are a fun/fitness rider, your options are rucksack,
saddlebag, or pockets. The rucksack option is useful when you are just
starting out, since it means you can get going with one less purchase,
but if you're going to be riding mainly on roads, you'll soon want
that off your back. Offroad riders tend to use rucksacks that can
carry water bladders (known as hydration packs or Camelbaks, after the
most famous makers of these things), as water bottles tend to bounce
off your bike and are more difficult to drink from when it's bumpy. If
you go this route, make sure you get one with some space to carry bits
and bobs (a basic toolkit, mobile phone, etc). Road riders usually
either have a small pack under the seat to carry essentials, or if
they are travelling really light, they will put just the bare minimum
of stuff in the back pockets of thier jerseys (special cycling
shirts). </p>

<h3>Lock</h3>

If you are a utility cyclist, this is your first absolutely essential
purchase (after the bike of course). The best lock for this use is a
heavy hardened steel D-lock (aka U-lock in the US). <b>Always lock
your frame up to something, never just the wheels!</b> Wheels can be
easily taken off, and you might come back to find you have just a very
securely locked wheel. Because wheels can be easily removed, if you have
quick-release skewers on your utility bike, consider replacing them
with Allen key ones. These make it more likely that your wheels will
still be attached to your bike when you return to it. Alternatively,
you can carry a cable lock as well to secure your wheels. Actually,
it's a good idea to have a cable lock anyway if you will be locking
your bike in different places, as it allows you to lock your bike to a
tree or lamp post that your D-lock will not fit around.</p>

<p>If you're a fun/fitness cyclist, a lock will probably not be necessary 
when you first first start out, as you'll be doing fairly short rides
that begin and end at your house, with no stops in between. But when
you start doing longer rides you'll need to stop for refuelling, and
cafes are ideal for this. Unless you can sit right nesxt to a window
where you can keep an eye on your bike, it's best to lock it up. A
thin light cable lock should be sufficient here.</p>

<b>Maintenance/Emergency Tools</b>

<p> Like any vehicle, a bicycle will require repairs from time to time
and tire punctures are not uncommon on longer rides. I would say that
if you are going for a ride longer than about 3 miles, then at the
very least you will want to pack a puncture repair kit including a
pump, spare tube, and tire levers when you are out. It is also useful
to carry a tube patch kit in case you get more than one puncture, and
Allen keys to do minor adjustments. Utility riders can stick this
toolkit in their rucksack or pannier. Offroad riders will put this in
their hydration pack. Road cyclists will usually attach the pump to
the frame of their bikes using the bracket provided, and will put the
tools/spare tube in thier jersey pockets or saddlebag.</p>

<b>Lighting</b>

<p> If you're going to be riding to work year round in the UK, then
lights are a must, as it gets dark around 4pm in the winter. Lights
are also very useful for fun/fitness riders: if you want to do a
weekday ride in the winter and work during the day, then you will be riding at
night. In addition to using lights at night, you should make sure that
you have something light-colored (eg yellow) and reflective on your
body at night. If you have a dedicated cycling jacket, this can do the
job on its own. If not, you can get a waistcoat or vest (a highway
works safety vest works very well, or you can get cycle-specific ones)
or a "Sam Browne" flourescent/reflective belt.</p>

<p>There are three main options for lights. By far the most common are
small battery-powered lights that attach to your handlebars, seatpost,
or rack. While there are some still available that have old-fashioned
incandescent bulbs, LEDs are definitely the way to go here: white LEDs
for the front, and red LEDs for the rear. You can get very reasonably
priced sets that include a front and rear light and brackets to attach
them to your handlebar and seatpost. However, if you have a rear rack,
then you should look to get a light that is meant to attach to a rear
rack. The batteries on these last longer (since they use larger
batteries) and they have a big reflector built in, further increasing
your visibility. These lights require a mounting plate with holes 80mm
apart, so if you ever buy a rack for your bike, get one with a
light-mounting plate with holes 80mm apart. </p>

<p> Commuters who ride along unlit lanes and fun/fitness cyclists who
ride at night will often want a headlight brighter than these small
LED headlights with the batteries in them. To get this brighter light,
you generally need a bigger battery, which means that the battery is
separate from the light and attached to it with a power cord. Here you
have a choice of several different types of battery and several
different types of lighting heads. There are some articles about
high-powered bike lights on this website (for example, see <a
href="lights.html">Halogen-Bulb High-Powered Bike Lights</a>) but
frankly they are out of date and need to be revised! I just need to
find the time... </p>

<p> The last option is one of the oldest technologies: lighting
powered by dynamos (generators in the US). Don't laugh! If your
experience with dynano-powered lighting systems is from a bike that
your Mom used to have 20 years ago, then you need to take a look at
what's avalable now. Check out my article on dynamos (<a
href="dynamos.html">Dynamo (Generator) Lights: Fact vs Fiction</a>)
for some more up-to-date info. In my opinion, the lighting systems
decribed in this article are by far the best for the regular
commuter.</p>

<h3>Waterproof Jacket</h3>

<p> This is essential to the utility rider and a very good idea for
the fun/fitness rider. You should look for a jacket without any kind
of insulation (since you will want to wear it even when it's not very
cold, and you can wear a fleece or sweater underneath to keep warm
when it is very cold) that is brightly colored and has lots of
reflective stuff. (Riders who only go offroad may want to skip the
"brightly colored" bit, but everyone else should avoid dark colored
jackets.) The ideal jacket is very light in weight and can be easily
folded into a bag (rucksack, pannier, or saddle bag), but there is a
tradeoff between light weight, waterproofness, and cost. The
important thing is to find something serviceable that will efficiently
deflect moisture. A hood will help keep you dry when you're off the
bike, but it's a very bad idea to use a hood when riding as it cuts
down your side vision. </p>

<h3>Hydration</h3>

<p> This is mainly for fun/fitness cyclists, as utility cyclists
usually don't go on rides long enough that you need to drink en
route. One universal problem among beginning cyclists is failure to
stay well-hydrated. Exercise and fitness experts recommend drinking
water every 20 minutes. There are a variety of ways to carry water
with you while you ride, from bottle racks attached to the frame to
hydration packs worn on the cyclist's back. In the latter case, tubing
from the pack is positioned near the riders mouth so he can drink
without having to slow or stop his ride. The hydration pack is usually
used by offroad riders. </p>

<h3>Ride Computer</h3>

<p> This is something that all cyclists can use. For a serious fitness
rider it is essential to know how far you went, and how fast, but even
for the utility and casual rider it's nice to know the distance you
travelled. Basic models tell you trip distance, total distance,
average speed and top speed, and journey time. More expensive models
can have a huge array of functions, such as position (via GPS), heart
rate, altitude, or calories burned. I recommend starting with a cheap
basic one and then, if you find you need more fancy features later on,
upgrade as needed.</p>

<h3>Padded Shorts</h3>

<p> These are pretty much essential to anyone who rides further than
say 15 miles at a stretch. Even professional cyclists have been known
to drop out of long-distance races due to the pain of "saddle sores,"
a condition that can be avoided (or at least made bearable) with
proper clothing and a proper bike saddle. While it may be stating the
obvious, men and women are built differently. Be sure to buy shorts
designed for your gender. In general, shorts with more panels in them
fit better and cost more. Shorts with somewhat heavier weight material
last longer and are more supportive, and are of course more expensive. </p>

<h3>Proper Saddle</h3>

<p> If you only make short trips on your bike you will probably get
on all right with the saddle that came with your bike. However, as
you up the mileage, you may find that your saddle becomes, quite
literally, a pain in the ass! The main thing to look for in a saddle
is that most of the weight should be on the "sit bones". These are
kind of bumps in the shape of your pelvis, and you can feel them when
you sit on a hard flat surface like a table. You want the wieght to be
on these rather than on the soft tissue between the sit bones because,
simply put, pressure on your soft tissue will over time cause blisters
or excruciating pain. Saddles usually come in womens and mens
versions. This is because women usually have sit bones that are
further apart than men do. Most women get along better with women's
saddles than men's; however I usally find the women's ones too wide
and prefer a not-very-narrow men's saddle instead. Unfortunately,
saddle choice is a highly personal thing, and what works for one
person often doens't work for another person who seems to be built the
same way and have the same kind of riding style. The best advice I can
give is to ask your friends what they like and, if possible, get them
to loan you a saddle so you can try it out. Some bike shops have
loaner saddles for you to try, and this is a good idea too. </p>

<h3>Helmet</h3>

<p>OK, this is an article about cycle accessories, so I need to say
something about helmets, which is probably the number 1 thing that
people think of when they hear the word "cycle accessory". Way back
when, say 15 years ago, I thought that helmets were absolutely
essential for cycling and I would never leave for a ride without
mine firmly attached to my head. However, in the intervening years I
have read an awful lot about cycling safty, accident statistics, etc,
and the following is my opinion now. Cycle helmets can reduce the
severity of injuries in some situations, but I do not feel that all
forms of cycling are dangerous enough to require that a helmet be worn
all the time. There are some situations where a helmet is a very good
idea, such as hardcore offroad riding. There are other situations
where I don't feel that a helmet is necessary, such as popping down to
the corner shops to buy a pint of milk and a loaf of bread. I will
leave it to you decide if the kind of riding you do is the kind where
you need a helmet. Whether or not you buy a helmet, make sure that you
ride safely, obeying traffic laws (see my article on <a
href="bike-saf.html">Bicycle Safety</a>), use lights at night, and
dress visibly at all times. I feel these will do more to prevent an
injury than wearing a helmet, but if in addition you want to wear a
helmet for just that little bit more protection, then go ahead.</p>

<p> If you do buy a helmet, then here are some things to look
for. First, make sure it fits. If you have a small head do not buy one
of these "one-size-fits-all" helmets. With those helmets, there may be
some mechanism to actually attach the way oversized helmet to your
head so that it won't fall off, but it won't protect you in a
collision as well as a properly fitting helmet. Second, get one that's
round. The fashion now is for helmets with pointy back parts. These
serve no purpose other than looks and can catch on the ground and whip
your head around if you crash. My helmet is the Bell Metro, which is
an excellent example of a round helmet. Third, get one that's a light
color to help with visibility. To be honest, you may have enough
difficulty finding a round helmet that fits you, so that finding one in a
light color would be simply impossible. In this case, stick some
reflective tape on it and call that good enough. </p>
