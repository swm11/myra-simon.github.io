<h1>Lighting Guide</h1>

<p> There are hundreds of bike lights out there. What do you need for
the kind of riding you do? This article aims to outline the main
options to help you make an informed decision. First I will discuss
the three major classes of lights, from least bright to most
bright. </p>

<p> <b>Small battery-powered lights.</b> These are the first lights
most people buy, and for many people they are good enough that they
never buy others. Generally speaking, what we're talking about here is
a red rear LED light and a headlight with either a halogen
incandescent bulb or white LEDs. The rear lights mount to a seatpost
or a rear rack or (occasionally) seat stays, and run off of AA, AAA,
or N-type batteries. The front lights are generally bigger and mount
to the handlebars, and run off of AA batteries, or sometimes C or D
cells. These batteries are contained in the body of the lamp. Many
manufactorers make good rear lamps, but in my opinion the only brand
worth considering for a front lamp is Cateye. For more information on
specific products, see my articles <a href="vistalite.html">Low-Power
Lights</a> and <a href="whiteLED.html">White LED lights</a>. </p>

<p> The advantages of these lights are that they are cheap to buy and
easy to attach to your bike. For rear lights, this may be all you will
even need, as you can buy rear red LED lights that are plenty bright
enough and have a plenty long run time. You can even get rear lights
that bolt to your bike, thus discouraging thieves. However, there are
some disadvantages to the front lights. It is nearly impossible to buy
front lights that bolt to the bike, so every time you park the bike
somewhere you have to remove them or risk getting them stolen. Another
problem is that unless you get a front light with white LEDs, the
batteries don't last very long, thus costing you alot in battery
replacement. Also you run the rick of running out of juice in the
middle of a ride if you're not careful about replacing batteries as
soon as the light starts to go dim. And while white LED lights have a
long run-time and are very visible (at least the larger ones made by
Cateye that take 4 AA batteries), they do not illuminate the road very
well. </p>
