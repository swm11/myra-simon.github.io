<p> This are my opinions about bicycle helemts. They have been formed
over many years of riding bikes, both on and off road, with and
without a helmet. My opinions are backed up by facts, but they are
still, at the end of the day, simply my opinions. </p>

<h2>Part One: Do you need a bicycle helmet?</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> If you look on the Web, you'll often see statements like this:</p>

<h4>Bicycle Safety Rule #1: Always Wear a Helmet</h4>

<p> Reading stetements like these, you might think that as long as you
wear a helmet you'll be safe. Well, this is not my belief at all. I've
written a <a href="bike-saf.html">very long article</a> on what I feel
goes into making you safe while riding in traffic. If you haven't read
that article, please do so, as I feel it is the most important article
of all my bike web pages. To summarize in one sentence, the advice I
give is that you should follow traffic laws, ride predictably, and be
vigilant at all times.</p>

<p> I feel that people who make helmet wearing into a big issue about
cycling safety are doing cyclists a disservice for several reasons:

<ul>
<li> They relegate safe cycling techniques, like those I describe in
my article, to a minor role. I feel that these techniques are far more
effective in avoiding injuries than wearing a helmet.

<li> Often people who promote helmets make cycling sound very
dangerous. In fact cycling is quite safe, and this scaremongering is
just as likely to turn people off from cycling completely as it is to
get them to wear a helmet while cycling.

<li> They exaggerate the effectiveness of a helmet. Let's face it, a
helmet is a light piece of styrofoam. In order to be light enough and
well ventilated enough to be tolerable on a bike, the potential
protective benefits of a helmet are greatly sacrificed. Compare a bike
helmet to a motorcycle helmet: which one do you think would provide
more protection in a crash?

<li> They are so bent on getting people to wear helmets that they
imply that any helmet, as long as you wear it, will protect you.
However, if you apply some reason to it, you'll come to the conclusion
that some helmets are much safer than others. See Part Two of this
article for my advice on how to select a safe helmet, if you decide
that you do want to wear one.
</ul>

<h4>Why I usally wear a helmet</h4>

<p> I actually do wear a helmet most of the time. Why? I strongly feel
that safe cycling techniques are far more important than wearing a
helmet in preventing injuries, and I know that helmets can provide
only minimal protection in a crash. These would be good reasons not to
wear a helmet, and often I don't. But usually I do. Probably the real
reason that I wear a helmet most of the time is that I'm paranoid. I
may make a mistake, or some motorist may make a mistake, and I might
get into the sort of accident where the helmet can have some effect in
lessening the damage done to my head. I am a wife and a mother. I have
other people to take care of. So I wear it for the same reason I wear
a neon yellow jacket and have three reflectors on the rear of my bike:
I want to do the most I can to keep myself intact. But you must keep
in mind that I believe that the neon yellow jacket and the three
reflectors are actually more important in preventing injurues than the
helmet that I also wear. </p>

<p> There's another, secondary reason why I wear a helmet. It's
because I have chosen my helmet very carefully, so it is, I feel,
about the safest helmet I could buy, while still being light and
ventilated enough to make it comfortable to wear. In addition to the
possibility that it might protect me in a crash, it offers safety
benefits that can help prevent a crash. (See below, in Part Two.)

<h4>The vegetable argument for wearing a helmet</h4>

<p> I would like to comment on the following line of reasoning, which
I have heard many times amongst people who feel that helmets are an
integral part, if not the most important part, of cycling safety: "If
you ride a bike without a helmet you are being nothing short of
irresponsible. If you crash and are turned into a vegetable, it's our
tax money that's going to keep you alive, hooked up to the ventilator,
drooling over your hospital bed" (The tax money argument only applies
to civilised countries where every person has a right to health care,
rather than it being a lottery, as it is in the US.) The simple fact
is that car crashes result in far more people being turned into
vegatables than bike crashes. Would this speaker be interested in
forcing all car drivers to wear helmets? No, I didn't think so. He
probably <i>feels</i> that cars are safe, and the large number of
people who die in cars every years doesn't change his opinion. What
kind of reasoning is this? </p>

<p> Furthermore, even if you do all your cycling without a helmet,
your life expentency will rise, not fall. This is because, even though
your risk of dieing of a violent death rises a tiny amount when you
cycle instead of driving, a you will get more exercise, and this will
reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, etc, sufficiently that
your can expect to live longer, and have a better quality of life
while you do. </p>
