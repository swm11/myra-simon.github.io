<h1>The South Downs Way, Take 1</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This weekend of September 9th and 10th I went to ride the South
Downs Way with <a href="http://www.trailbreak.co.uk/">Trail Break</a>.
The plan was to ride 60 miles the first day, then 40 miles the
second. </p>

<p> It started out pretty well. I set off at my usual steady pace. At
first I was a bit disappointed that the South Downs Way wasn't very
technical; it's mostly smooth dirt. But then i realized that if I wa
doing 60 miles of this in one day, probably a smooth trail would be
better. And I do centuries on the road, which is even less
challenging, so I contented myself with treating this more like a road
century than an off-road ride.  </p>

<p> I noticed that my confidence on hills has increased quite a bit. While
on technical downhills I'm as slow as ever, I was often letting the
brakes go completely on the reasonably smooth downhills and picking up
quite a bit of speed. I felt pretty cool blsting down the hills. </p>

<p> Until I crashed on one of them, about 45 miles from the start. Not
really sure what happened, one moment I was flying downhill, the next
moment I was on the ground.  I inspected myself. A small gouge below
my right knee, a scrape on my right elbow, but the big problem was my
shoulder. It hurt. Lots. </p>

<p> Trailbreak have water stops about every 10 miles, and I was about 5
miles from the previous one. I got back on the bike and limped the
next 5 miles, pushing up and down the steeper bits, braking carefully
with my left hand only. I finally got to the water stop and packed it
in. </p>

<p> They took me to the local hospital for a checkup (they had to collect
one guy who was taken there there earlier) and I had a sprained
shoulder.  Nothing major, and it's healing OK. But doing Sunday's ride
was out of the question. So on Sunday I was making sandwiches at the
lunch stop instead of riding my bike. </p>

<p> And it's made me think hard. No matter how good a biker you are, if
you're flying down a hill fast even a little rock can throw you off,
and the faster you're going the more likely you are to get hurt when
you land. </p>

<p> So I was having fun and felt very cool flying down the hills, but
would I have rather gone more slowly and done the entire 100mi 2 day
ride rather than crashing after only 45 miles?  </p>

<p> I'm afraid that I have to say the former...  </p>

<p> So I think it's time to go slower on the hills than I really feel that
I'm capable of doing. </p>

<p> And I also realize that my policy of being extra-cautious when I'm out
on my own is indeed a very good one. While I was on my Wales trip this
summer I was keeping my brakes on on those sorts of downhills, and so
although I crashed I didn't get hurt. On Saturday's crash quite a few
people stopped to ask if I was OK, and offered to phone Trailbreak
with their mobiles. I only would have had to walk to the nearest road
if I'd been too injured to ride. </p>

<p> Anyway, that's the story of my first attempt at the South Downs
Way. I'll be back next year, and I'm definitely going to complete it
then. </p>
