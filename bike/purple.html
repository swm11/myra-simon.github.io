<h2>My Purple Problem</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> Mountain bikers seem to be obsessed with equipment. At least, more
so than their roadie brethren. Sure there are exceptions, but it seems
that most mountain bikers yearn for the shiniest, newest, trickest,
most expensive bikes and bits. Happily bikes aren't all that expensive
(in comparison to, say cars and houses) so people of even modest means
can and do have the bike of their dreams. </p>

<p> I too have caught upgrade fever. I did put up a fight, I really did. I
got my mountain bike, a Trek 950, in January 1996. It was a nice rigid
steel bike with a mix of STX-RC and Deore LX parts; 24 speeds with
RapidFire shifters. For two years I kept the bike pretty much as it
was. But then, as I got into the off-road thing and rode it more,
things started to wear out. By December 1997, it wasn't shifting so
well anymore, since the chain and cassette were getting worn. The shop
also told me that the bottom bracket needed replacing. And I wanted
V-brakes, since I was getting tired of continually readjusting my
cantilevers. </p>

<p> The bike shop guy suggested I just buy a new bike. He pointed at the
new Trek 950, which had been upgraded to include a suspension fork and
V-brakes. It seemed very nice. I thought about it. I looked at my old
bike. It had served me well, which is why the drivetrain had worn
out. And to throw it away for a younger, better dressed sibling? No,
I just couldn't do it. </p>

<p> So I upgraded instead. First I replaced the chain, cassette, and
bottom bracket. Then, after careful research, I chose some V-brakes. 
They were XTRs. I had to replace my integrated shifters/brake levers
as well, and I got XT versions. So my bike was as good as new. Better,
in fact.  </p>

<p> And yet I wasn't happy.  </p>

<p> I have always admired pretty colored anodized bike parts. Well, I've
admired anodized stuff in general (one of the reasons I own Mag-Lite
torches) and have often thought that I would like some on my bike.
Since my bike is a sort of dark turquoise, I thought purple would look
good with it. </p>

<p> Purple anno. Such an MTB cliche. I couldn't. No, really, it would look
just too silly. But, then, gee, it's awfully pretty... </p>

<p> So I did it. Soon my bike featured purple bottle cages, handlebar,
quick release skewers, and random bolts. My boyfriend says I have a
purple problem.  </p>

<p> Funny, I'm still embarrassed to admit to all my anodized parts. I worry
that people will think I'm trying to impress them with the coolness of
my bike. But really, it's just for me, because I think it looks nice.
And I'm the first to admit that it doesn't make me a better rider. Yet
I can't help feeling good when someone admires it. </p>

<p> Of course, the upgrades didn't end there. I got a suspension fork and
new wheels (which I made myself), and even now I contemplate other new
bits. A suspension seatpost? New lights? </p>

<p> I try to make rules for myself about what I'm allowed to upgrade. The
replacement has to a substantial step up from the old part for me to
justify it. Or it has to be purple. </p>

<p> Perhaps to atone for all this, I've bought a vintage mountain bike.
It's a 1989 Fisher AL-1, one of the first alumimum bikes Fisher
made. It's got Shimano Deore parts. Yes, plain Deore, before they
started putting letters after it. It has a 7 speed cassette, thumb
shifters, Biopace chainrings, toe clips. Of course it's completely
rigid. </p>

<p> And yet I find myself wanting to change it. It needed bar-ends so I
could have a change of hand positions. But, I swear, that's all I'm
going to do to it. It's going to stay stock, a real authentic old MTB. </p>

<p> Oh, but wouldn't it be nice to rebuild the wheels with shiny new
stainless steel spokes, to replace the slightly rusty ones...? </p>
