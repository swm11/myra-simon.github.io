<h1>MTBing in Llanwrtyd Wells</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Llanwrtyd Wells, in Mid-Wales near Llandovery, is a great base for
some good mountain biking. There are hills a-plenty, and a huge
variety of tracks, from very technical climbs and downhills to easy
wide forest roads. In addition, you'll find plenty of scenery to keep
you entertained, from pretty streams to hills and wide valleys. </p>

Finding routes is no problem. First, there's the <i>Llanwrtyd Wells
Cycle Guide</i>, which has 5 off-road and 3 on-road routes. These
routes are printed on cards and slide into the plastic cover of the
book. The cards have hand-drawn maps that are accurate enough that you
can find the tracks on on OS map, but aren't accurate enough to help
you get back on track if something goes wrong. The written directions
are helpful. In addition there are quite a few markers (saying CTC, as
the CTC helped sponsor the effort) on fence posts. In some places the
farmers have taken them down so they can't be relied on. The book
itself isn't very useful if you're an experienced cyclist, as it just
tells you the general stuff you know already. Some of the route cards
can be bought separately. This is the way to go if you can find
them. </p>

<p> I did two of the Cycle Guide routes, Routes 4 (Irfon Forest) and 5
(Mynydd Trawsnant), as well of bits of many of the others. Route 4 was
great. It had nice views and some very challenging tracks, along with
some boring fire road, especially the boring fire road climb at the
beginning. To eliminate the initial boring part, follow Route 2 (The
Garn) until it meets up with Route 4. Route 5 had one some nice bits,
notably the bridleway between described by the directions between 2
and 3 on the card, and the bridleway bit starting at 4 and ending at
the Abergwesyn Road. However, the rest of the route way boring road or
fire road. </p>

<p> If Cycle Guide routes aren't enough for you, UK MTB magazines have
done quite a few routes around there, many of which are stuck into
picture frames and put on the wall of the Neuadd Arms Hotel. You can
take them down to mark up your map if you're looking for more
inspiration. I did one of these that was published in MRB in summer
'99. It was a 30 mile route through forests, around Llyn Briane, and
through the amazingly scenic Doethie Valley. The track through the
valley was worth it all. It was a narrow track contouring along the
side of the valley, and I was very sad when it was over.</p>

<h4>Accommodation and Facilities</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The <a href="http://llanwrtyd-wells.powys.org.uk/index1st.htm">
Llanwrtyd Wells tourism page</a> has an extensive list of B&Bs and
hotels, and you can camp on the rugby grounds. </p>

<p> There is a bike shop in town, called Irfon Cycles. They hire out
rigid MTBs and have a pretty decent collection of spares. They sell a
limited selection of bikes. There's also a post office, small chemist,
a garage, and a Spar to provide your caloric needs. Behind the Neuadd
Arms Hotel is a small launderette.

<h4>Other Activities</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> If not everyone in your family or group loves mountain biking,
there's still plenty of outdoorsy stuff to do around Llanwrtyd
Wells. Among them are walking, pony trekking, and bird watching. If
your friends are the indoors, I love shopping type, leave them at
home. Llanwrtyd Wells is pretty small and only has a few little, very
utilitarian shops.  </p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Undoubtedly, the center of activity in the town is the 
<a href="http://www.neuaddarmshotel.co.uk/">Neuadd Arms
Hotel</a>. The proprietor Gordon Green organizes most of the events in
the town, including things for walkers, beer lovers, bird watchers,
and horseriders as well as mountain bikers. I participated in the <a
href="bog-snork.html">Mountain Bike Bog Snorkelling World
Championships</a>, which was great fun. </p>
