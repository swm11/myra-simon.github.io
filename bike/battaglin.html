<p><i> This is a modified version of a test of women's road
bikes I wrote for Cycling Plus in August '99. All the bikes I tested
(Cannondale R600 Compact Triple, Vision Pocket Rocket, Battaglin
Bambino) were based on 650c (ISO 571mm) wheels.  Since this was meant
to be a test of bikes for women, and because not all the bikes fit me,
I invited as many roadie women as I could find to ride the bikes and
give me their opinions. </i> </p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The Battaglin Bambino (contact Ricci 01209 215787) is intended for
young racers. The steel frame sports Campagnolo Avanti transmission
and brakes. Again, it has 650c wheels. It costs £599. Unfortunately,
since it is a child's bike, it is far too small for me. </p>

<p> When it came to me to test it had a stupidly long stem on
it. Evidently the gals they were using for the Cycling Plus photo
shoot found the specced 70mm stem too short, so they replaced it with
a 120mm one, which Cycling Plus left on when they sent it to
me. Great... I put the 90mm CODA stem from the Cannondale on it for
testing, so that the ladies I invited over for testing could sensibly
ride the thing. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Frame</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The cheerful yellow frame of the Battaglin has a classic look
thanks to slim steel tubes, lugs, and a seat pin binder bolt set into
the seat cluster. Unfortunately it is too small for me. It was
slightly too small for 5' riders; we think it might fit someone about
4'10". It comes with one bottle braze-on. The front tire barely
touches the end of my toe, so I expect there would be no overlap for
smaller riders with smaller feet. There are no provisions for
mudguards. The main problem with the frame is that it's heavy: the
frame and forks are 5.3 lb, fully one pound heavier than the larger
Vision and Cannondale frames. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Handling</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I like a bike that goes where I want with little effort. The
handing of the Battaglin was very skittish. It took me some time to
feel confident enough to ride with my hands on the tops of the bars,
and I felt wary going around corners.  I wondered it this might be
happening because it is far too small for me. However, in comparison
the small Trek WSD bike I borrowed from a local shop (Ben Haywards)
had a very steady ride, although the Trek is only slight larger than
the Battaglin. Possibly it is the short wheelbase of the Battaglin
(88cm vs 95cm for the Trek, 93.5cm for the Cannondale, and 94cm for
the Vision) that made it feel so unstable. Also, it's possible that
I'm simply too heavy and tall for the bike, and that the small light
person that this bike is designed for would find it much tamer.
However, based on the reports of the smaller test riders, even these
people would find the Trek much more stable than the Battaglin. </p>

<p> Of course, not everyone likes the same thing, and some riders liked
the quicker, less stable handling of the Vision and the Battaglin.
They felt that they would be happy riding the more frisky bikes in
short road races or training rides, while they would prefer the
Cannondale or Trek for longer rides, especially centuries.

<h4>Wheels</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> At the center of the Battaglin wheels are fairly basic Campagnolo
hubs.  The rims are Ambrosio Elite, with a black coating that looks
sharp now but will soon become tatty as the color wears off the
braking surfaces. There are 36 fat (2mm) plain gauge spokes holding it
together, making the wheels look like they were built for an elephant,
not a child or small adult. Using 32 double butted spokes (2.0/1.8mm)
would lose weight and would built into a plenty strong wheel. </p>

<p> The rim tape on the Battaglin wheels is very low quality. It is too
stretchy, allowing the tube to balloon out into the spoke holes. I got
a puncture in one tube due to this. The tire was only pumped up to
100psi, although it was rated for 120psi.</p>

<p> Spoke tension isn't particularly high in the Battaglin, nor it is
even. Some time spent with a spoke wrench would reward you with more
reliable wheels.</p>

<p> This bike, like all the official test bikes, came with 20mm
tires. Since this bike has such a harsh ride, it would benefit greatly
from the greater comfort offered by wider 23mm tires. </p>

<h4>Equipment</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/chainset-sm.jpg" alt="Miche chainset" align="right"
     ALIGN="center" width=287 height=218 hspace="5">

<p> The Battaglin is equipped with a complete Campagnolo Avanti groupset,
except for a Miche chainset. The shifting and braking work fine, and
the 155mm cranks are perfect for this size bike.  The only complaint I
have is that the bike is badly undergeared with a big chainring of 42
teeth. I could roll along comfortably in top gear at the modest speed
of 21mph, and it was all I could do to maintain 26mph. The bolt circle
diameter of the chainset is 122mm, which seems to be an unusual
size. I don't know of a source of rings in this size, to get a larger
chainring you may have to get it custom made by someone like Chris
Bell of Highpath Engineering (UK phone 01570 470035). </p>

<p> The headset is threaded and comes with a sensible-length 70mm stem
(although, as I noted above, I never saw this stem). The 38cm wide
handlebars were appreciated by most of the riders. We all found that
the shifting and braking from the tops of the brake hoods was no
problem with the Campag shifters, but braking from the drops
was difficult. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Comfort</h4>

<blockquote>

Comfort is mainly a factor of three things: the saddle, position
on the bike, and how well the bike absorbs road shock.</p>

<p> I didn't get along with the funny blue stripey saddle that came
with this bike, but since saddles are such a personal thing, this is
hardly worth mentioning. </p>

<p> Aluminum bikes have a reputation of having a harsh ride, but this
isn't the case with the bikes in this test: the aluminum bikes in the
test have a smoother ride than the Battaglin. Since the Battaglin,
Vision and Cannondale all came with 20mm high-pressure tires, the
tires weren't causing this difference. It certainly isn't due to the
Battaglin having a stiffer frame than the others. Cannondales have
just about the stiffest frames you'll find (see Damon Rinard's
<a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard_frametest.html">
frame stiffness tests</a>). The likely reason for the
rough ride is geometry. The Battaglin had a considerably shorter
wheelbase than the other bikes, as mentioned above under Handling. 
This makes bumps feel bigger, see
<a href="geometry.html#wb-bumps">Wheelbase and perceived bumps</a>. </p>

<p> For a small rider (just under 5 feet tall), the position on the
Battaglin is be a good balance between being stretched out and
upright. For me it was hopeless. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> This seems to be a decently-equipped bike with a sensible frame
geometry. However, there is no reason for such a small bike have such
a heavy frame. Even built up this bike is noticeably heavier than the
Cannondale, Vision, or Trek. Now all of these bikes cost alot more
than the Battaglin, but you can get far better bikes with 700c wheels
for about the same price. Glancing at my Trek 2000 catalog I see: Trek
1000, Alpha alu frame, Shimano 8-speed Sora equipment with double or
triple chainset, 500 pounds. Trek 1200, Alpha SL alu frame, Shimano
9-speed Tiagra equipment with double chainset, 650 pounds. It seems
like you're paying a real premium to get a small frame. </p> 

<p> I've done a fair bit of looking around for an alternative, and I
think I've got one. <a
href="http://www.orbit-cycles.co.uk/index2.htm">Orbit</a> make a bike,
the Mercury Race, with 650c wheels for £460 with STI shifters, or 400
for downtube. The components aren't as nice as those on the Battaglin,
but the frame ought to be lighter than the frame of the Battaglin. At
least it would be hard for it to be heavier! The main problem with it
is that it only comes in one size, 18". </p>

<p> If you would like more choice, check out <a
href="http://www.deesidecycle.u-net.com/">Deeside Cycles</a>, who have
their own line of bikes. They offer frames in a huge variety of
materials fitted with a huge variety of equipment. Their small (18"
and 19") frames have reasonably short top tubes, however with such
small bikes made with 700c wheels there are inevitably
compromises. They tell me that they can do their bikes in custom sizes
for 50 pounds extra, and this includes bikes with 650c wheels. They
are also able to make the bikes completely to your specification, so
if you ride a friend's Cannondale Compact, and find that the size
really suits you, you could take the geometry specs to Deeside and get
something similar made for yourself. You could get yourself a basic
7005 aluminum frame with Shimano Sora equipment for 617 pounds. Not
quite as good a deal as the Trek 1000, but it seems to be better
value-for-money than the Battaglin. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, I haven't actually ridden a Mercury or one of
these Deeside bikes, nor do I know of anyone who has one. So I can't
really vouch for their quality. Both Orbit and Deeside's proprietor,
Graham Weigh, have a good reputation, but that's all I can go on.</p>
