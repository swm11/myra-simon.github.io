<h4>What size small wheel?</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<P>Wheels for cycle tyres are
logically sized according to the diameter where the tyre bead sits on
a shoulder inside the rim. It's the only measurement that can be made
on both tyre and rim and generally coincides with the middle of the
brake block. The common 700C measures 622mm. Tyres are described by
section and diameter accordingly: 32-622 and a good approximation to
overall diameter is obtained by adding twice the tyre section to this
figure, viz: twice 32 plus 622 equals 686mm - near enough 27in.</P>

<h4>590</h4>

<p>The next rim diameter down from 622mm (700C) that is worth any
consideration is known as 26x1 3/8 the world over or 650A in
France. It doesn't come with much of a diameter reduction and its only
real advantage is that tyres in this size exist even in undeveloped
countries: but often in scarce quantities and seldom of good
quality. And you can't get any nice alloy rims. Forget it.</P>

<h4>584</h4>

<p>This size is known as 650B in France (26x1½ British), where a
reasonable choice of tyres in various useful touring widths remains
available. (I believe the Japanese like this size too, but apparently
not for export.) Note the word 'remains'. I do not think many if any
new bicycles are being mass-produced with 650Bs even in France, and so
this has the appearance of a dying size (like our 27x1¼) for which
tyres remain available only because Europeans expect a bicycle to last
a lifetime - and why not! My guess is that choice will slowly dwindle
to leave a few unexciting, basic tyres in the long term. </P>

<h4>571</h4>

<p>I get occasional letters from members who've been built a
'touring' bike with 571mm rims and are looking for a sturdier tyre
than the 20mm ultra-high-pressure jobs it came with. Sadly I have to
disappoint them. This is a wired-on (or flexible bead) equivalent to
the 26in road-racing tubular. This size has its place - on a sports
bike not a tourer - and good prospects of long-term availability, but
don't expect anyone to manufacture tyres bigger than 25mm. </P>

<h4>559</h4>

<p>This, believe it or not, is the bead diameter of a 26in ATB
tyre. The ATB has taken the world market by storm and enthusiasts'
tendency to perch fat tyres on relatively narrow rims has led people
such as Mavic and Campag produce lots of useful touring-width
models. Compatible tyres of 30 to 37mm section also exist, which
produce a wheel something less than 25 inches in diameter - a really
useful reduction from 27in, but still not excessive. </P>

<P>The only snag is availability of these tyres, now and in the long
term. Reliable European tyre manufacturers have only geared up to make
the common widths of 47mm plus. There are presently only two narrower
touring-type tyres on the market, and both are offered by relatively
young marketing organisations with a reputation for conjuring products
out of their far-eastern suppliers in immediate response to the whims
of fashion, and for dropping them again the moment demand slackens!
They offer these tyres because something a bit different may tickle
the fancy of a zillion ATB owners, not because a few suckers have had
a bike built that will accept nothing else. They only offer them to
dealers who buy lots of their other stuff and if the zillions don't
fancy them they'll surely disappear. </P>

<P>At present Orbit Cycles is the only volume user of narrow 559s, and
they're a pretty small outfit. Rumours are, however, that some major
manufacturers may be going over to 559 for hybrid bikes, which is the
size they always should have come with and would be a step towards a
long-term future for smaller touring wheels. Ultimately we could do
with a full range of widths in each of a limited number of
diameters. I'm backing 559 as the next one below 622.</P>

<p>[2000 update: many people nowadays buy MTBs for commuting and
general use and are ditching the knobbly tires that came with them for
slicks. In addition, touring bikes based on MTB wheels are growing in
popularity. Thus there is a solid market for robust street tires, and
manufacturers are providing an ever-increasing selection of
them. However, there is still a lack of 'sensible' treaded tyres in 28
to 37mm sections. Practical and efficient European models such as
Conti-Top-Touring, Schwalbe Marathon, Vredestein Spider etc. come in
all sections down to 28-622 but only 47-559. Most of the several
32-559 that are now available are still semi-slicks, fine for people
who bought a MTB for road use, but merely okay for touring since they
don't offer much key on gravelly or muddy European bikepaths.]</P>

<h4>541</h4>

<p>A year or three ago, before all that teenagers wanted was a
mountain-bike, there were junior sports bikes with 24in
wheels. Peugeot's were 600A and Raleigh's were the slightly and
annoyingly different 24x1 3/8: bead diameters 541 and 540
respectively. There's still a fair choice of 600A tyres, 28 to 37mm
width, mostly from French manufacturers, and good prospects of a
continuing if small demand for this size. A few kids will always want
look-a-like road racers, and some lightweight folding bikes and HPVs
also need a wheel under 24in. </P>

 <P>Once upon a time Madison marketed a small Romany tourer with
600As. It was a sound concept, worth repeating.</P>

<h4>520</h4>

<p>This, I believe, is the size used by Georgena Terry for the
front wheel only of her smaller touring and sports bikes, designed
specifically for women. You can only get these bikes in America, which
is perhaps a good thing because that's the only place I know where you
can get these tyres. It's equivalent, however, to a 24in tubular and
could be useful if a few tyres of around 28 to 32mm section existed
(the widest I've seen pretends to be 28 but measures nearer 25) and if
only the marketplace wasn't already so cluttered with uneconomically
small quantities of umpteen other nominally 24 and 22in sizes.</P>

<h4>507</h4>

<p>I've skipped a whole load of sizes (mentioned above) to arrive
at the 24in ATB. A few nice adult mountain-bikes appeared with smaller
wheels at the beginning of the craze, but now this size is strictly
for the kids. That means unexciting performance and a limited range of
widths - all fat and knobbly. Unless kids move onto hybrids (unlikely)
that's the way it will stay, which seems a good place to halt this
trip down the ETRTO tyre size tables.</P>

<h4>The Brake Lever Problem</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<P>Small people have small hands and many women can only reach
standard issue brake levers with their fingertips. Modern drop
handlebar levers are generally closer to the bar than old designs, but
this is still not enough for some who must search for special
short-reach levers. ATB levers often have reach adjustment screws
which stop the lever springing back so far when released and an
ingenious person can always find some way of similarly reducing the
motion of any other design of lever. A wedge or screw etc can be glued
rivetted or screwed to the top of the lever so as to come up against
the lever hood at a point when the lever is still a little way from
its intended return position - or you can simply bend it a bit. It's
obvious, however, that if you reduce the amount of available lever
motion then the blocks don't move as far either - so small handed
people are forced to keep their brakes adjusted closer to the rim.</P>

<P>Hands that are weaker too compound the problem. By judicious choice
of brake and lever it is possible to assemble a system which amplifies
limited hand strength, but you can never get 'owt for nowt' and
increased leverage is also paid for by reduced movement of the brake
block. Systems that combine recent designs of low-profile cantilever
brakes and dropped handlebar levers (designed instead for racing
sidepull brakes) provide numerous examples of this, since mixing and
matching such barely compatible bits from Shimano's off and on-road
groupsets - the way most manufacturers assemble a touring bike these
days - requires the user has to maintain impractically close brake
adjustment or else the lever will come up against the handlebar before
the block even touches the rim. Optimum performance from modern
dropped bar levers is obtained instead with older designs of
mid-profile cantilever or with Mafac-style wide-profile types. (These
are generally cheaper so it's no hardship - but the bike won't look so
pretty!)  If the levers are short reach it is even more necessary to
avoid low-profile brakes.</P>

<P>We have to hope that body weight also reduces with size and
strength, so that weaker hands won't have to pull so
hard. Unfortunately this is often not the case and so the rider must
fit the grippyest brake blocks they can find and make every effort to
remove the twin evils of friction and lost motion from their cables,
so that as much as possible of what they put into one end comes out of
the other.</P>

<P>Ultimately there are hydraulic brakes. Nothing can get around the
force and motion trade-off, but hydraulics do virtually eliminate the
losses associated with cables.</P>

<h4>Saddles</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<P>To paraphrase a truism: 'One
man's seat is another's instrument of torture' and women seem to
suffer even more from bicycle saddles than men - perhaps because men
designed them. But despite coming from the US doyenne of women's
bicycles, the saddle designed most especially for women was also one
of the most intensely disliked of this test; see the Roberts'
write-up. </P>

<P>A range of Georgena Terry saddles is now imported by NTI (but not
her interesting bikes). All of them have a cutout or deliberately
weakened area in the hard plastic base, underlying the nose
area. Roberts had fitted the ATB racing model, and the kindest thing
we can say is that it must be better to bounce up and down on than
simply to sit upon all day! We also have a sample of the Terry touring
saddle on test which seems to suit it's rider quite well - expect a
report in a future issue.</P>

<P>Only one saddle seemed to be a clear winner with everyone who sat
on it: this was the Avocet Gelflex W20 fitted by George
Longstaff. Another popular model was Isobel's Brooks B17. The Selle
Italia Lady Turbo on the Islabike was too narrow and hard for some,
but one or two really liked it.</P>
