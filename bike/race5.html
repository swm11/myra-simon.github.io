<title>A Race in Trenton (Race #5)</title>
<h2>A Race in Trenton (Race #5)</h2>

This past Sunday, April 9th, we (Penn and the Quaker City Wheelmen)
hosted a race in Trenton's Cadwalader Park. This race consisted of
both collegiate and USCF races. Dr Pete, QCW treasurer and Penn
cycling team coach, seems to have organized the entire thing, so all
we did was show up to man the registration tables, act as marshals
(controlling car access to the park to make sure cars didn't block the
racers), and race.<p>

Us Penn people met at 6am and drove out to Trenton. My dad was down
visiting for the weekend, so he got to share with me the pleasure of
getting up at 5:30, tossing on some clothing, and heading out the door
barely awake.<p>

The weather was cool and damp. It had rained the night before, but was
just cloudy by the time we got there, and the race course had already
begun to dry up. We weren't expecting huge numbers of college folks --
they were all going to be in Ithaca for the weekend, attending
Cornell's races. However, we learned that on Saturday snow hit Ithaca,
canceling that day's races, and they weren't sure whether they'd be
able to do Sunday's races or not. So several people left Ithaca and
came here, where it's significantly warmer, for our race.<p>

The race was a criterium, along a 1.1 mile loop thru' the park. The
course goes like this: from the start/finish line you go down a hill
(which includes a gentle left curve), then along a slightly downhill
section. Then you make a left turn which is not bad at all -- at least
not bad for me now. The first time I did it, on the way back from one
of our NYC races, I was nervous about it, but it's a piece of cake in
comparison to the sharp left on the Bloomsburg course. Then there's a
slight uphill, then a left curve, then a steeper uphill, but still not
bad at all, especially in comparison with the Bloomsburg torture
course, and then you're at the finish line. The course was freshly
sweeped (Dad was drafted into helping with this) so we didn't worry
about gravel on the turns.<p>

There were 6 women all together. Two were doing the A race -- our
superwoman Tiffany and a Bucknell woman; the B riders were Lauren,
Amanda, and me from Penn, and a Bloomsburg woman. Yep, I'm riding B
from now on. I'm tired of getting ditched in the A races and riding
pretty much alone. The B race was supposed to start at 8am and consist
of 8 laps, and the A was supposed to start at 9:30 with 12 laps. But
with as few people as there were, Pete decided to combine them at 9:30
for 12 laps. I didn't mind, since it probably warmed up and dried out
a bit in the extra 1.5 hours, and the 12 laps certainly wouldn't hurt
me. Anyway, even tho' we'd start out together and ride the same
distance, we'd still be ranked separately.<p>

The Men's C/D and B races went off, and we rode around warming up. My
bike worked beautifully. After getting my chain stuck between the
middle and big chainrings in the race at Penn State past week, I knew
something had to be done about it. I took it to Paul Molino, owner of
Bike Addicts, 5548 Ridge Ave, for some expert help.  Paul is one of
our sponsors: he provides the technical support to keep our bikes in
top shape. He checked my bike out and fixed the problem by removing
the spacers between the two chainrings. Now there isn't enough space
between the two rings for the chain to get caught between them. He
also adjusted the rear derailleur, and as I rode home from the shop I
thought: I haven't had it shifting so nicely in quite some time.<p>

Finally, 9:30 rolled around, and it was our turn to race. Pete gave us
Penn people our instructions: us four B riders should make attacks,
trying to tire out the Bucknell woman, and then Tiffany could take
over and crush her. I suspected that us Bs wouldn't contribute much to
the A race, since we wouldn't be able to keep up with them, but I
figured we could give it a try. The race started. I started my
timer. Tiff and the Bucknell woman started out pretty quickly. I
grabbed a wheel and hung on. I stayed with them thru' the downhills,
and then after coming around the left turn into the slightly uphill
section, I felt I had some energy and I made an attack. I knew I'd get
get caught, but I felt I had to try to help out Tiffany. They passed
me at the base of the hill, and gained a bit on me going up the
hill. After the hill I worked hard and caught up with then, and rested
thru' the downhills. Again, after the left curve I felt I had some
energy, so I made another attack. Again I got caught, and they passed
me at the base of the hill. But this time they gained alot on me going
up the hill, and I was too tired to give much to the chase, so they
were gone. Oh, well, I didn't expect to be able to stay with them
anyway.  At least I was with them for 2 laps, while the rest of the B
riders got dropped pretty quickly.<p>

I went thru' the downhill sections alone, and then after the curve,
Lauren and Amanda caught me in the slight uphill -- the Bloomsburg
woman hadn't been able to keep up with them. I caught their draft and
rested. Trying to stay with the As had tired me. After a lap or two
I'd recovered and was able to take pulls. We alternated in a random
way -- wherever one of the people in back felt we weren't going fast
enough, she took off and the rest followed. I found that I was better
going up hills: if I wanted to I could make it to the top faster than
they did. But often I'd just relax and sit behind them, following them
up to the top. Since we went slower up the hill, Dad (who was
stationed right before the finish line) got lots of opportunities to
take nice pics of us.<p>

About 5 laps from the end I got to thinking -- how could I win this
(the B) race? Of course, it was against my own teammates, so it was
pointless as far as team standing, but I couldn't help wanting to do
as well as I could. I made a plan -- I'd noticed that Lauren and
Amanda were taking the left turn wider than I do -- that is, they'd go
thru' the sharpest part of the turn at the left edge of the road, but
then they'd swing out into the middle of the road, while I could hold
to the left of the road, keeping the distance shorter. I thought -- on
the last lap, I'll pass them in this part of the course, and then if I
can stay away, I've got it made.<p>

About 3 laps from the end, both Lauren and I stayed back, letting
Amanda lead. We had the same idea -- we want to win, and we want to be
fresh for the end. Lauren was behind Amanda, and I behind Lauren. On
the last lap, I kept my eyes open, waiting for Lauren to take off. She
did, on the slight downhill before the left turn. I caught her wheel
and stayed with her. She took the left turn wide, as she had before,
and I zoomed by on the left. I pedaled hard, doing about 23 thru' the
slightly uphill section. I worked at keeping up the speed, wanting to
put some distance between me and Lauren. And then I glanced back, and
she was right behind me. Oooops. "Oh, fuck" I said, resignedly. At
that point I knew she'd beat me. I had expended my energy reserves on
the burst of speed after passing her, and she had had a free ride,
sitting in my draft, and so when we got to the hill, she'd pass me and
there wasn't much I could do about it. And that's exactly what she
did. There wasn't any competition at all on the hill, she flew up and
I tried to muster some energy at the bottom, but when it was clear
that she was well in front of me, I eased off and sort of limped
across the finish line.<p>

We did a cool-down lap, and towards the end of it we saw Tiff and the
Bucknell woman. We asked how they did. They ignored us... At the end
of the extra lap, we stopped, found Tiff's dad (her family was
visiting her for the weekend), and asked him who won the race.
Bucknell, he said. Drat!<p>

Another drat -- I again forgot to turn off my timer at the end of the
race. I have only successfully timed one race. Maybe I should just
give up...<p>

We talked with Pete a bit, and then us Penn women gathered for a team
photo, with Pete in the official coach position on the right end.
Lauren and Tiff were going to race again, in the USCF races, but I
didn't feel like paying an extra $10 registration fee for a 5 mile
race, and so, after checking that no more help was needed for
registration and marshaling, Dad and I headed out.

In retrospect -- it's alot more fun to have people to ride with than
to ride alone, and I will stay with the B races. It would be nice if I
could win a race at some point, tho'. On Sunday I made a plan,
executed it perfectly, but the plan failed, since Lauren caught my
draft as I passed her -- I wasn't able to go fast enough to lose her.
So, obviously, it wasn't a good plan. In order to be a better racer,
I'm going to have to be smarter, or stronger, or, probably both.
There's lots more to learn...<p>
