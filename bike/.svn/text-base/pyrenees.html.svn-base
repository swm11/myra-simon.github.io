<h1>The Pyrenees</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> I spent June 5 through June 9th 1999 mountain biking in the Pyrenees
with Pyractif. Despite unpleasant weather and church bells waking me
up at all hours of the night, it was a great holiday. The riding was
among the best I've seen, with challenging tracks and fabulous
scenery. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.pyractif.com/">Pyractif</a> is run by Steve and
Brenda Mead, and recently they've added Crispin to their staff. They
operate out of a big converted farmhouse in the tiny village of
Bertren in the Luchon Valley, surrounded by tree-covered mountains and
an incredible network of trails. </p>

<tr><td> I got a flight with Air France. My bike
went as one of my two checked pieces of luggage, with no extra
charge. To get the bike ready to fly, I took off the pedals and bar
ends, turned my handlebars sideways, and replaced my suspension
seatpost and saddle with a plain seatpost. That's it, no deflated
tires, no bags or boxes, no bubble wrap or pipe lagging. When I got it
back the only damage was that the sticker on the stem had been
scratched, and one of the brake levers had rotated around the
handlebar. I realized that they had probably lain it down on its left
side to avoid getting the oily chain on anything. Since I had twisted
the handlebar around to the left, the brake & shift levers were
vulnerable. On the way back I rotated the handlebars to the right, and
when I retrieved it it was just as it was when I left it.

<p> I arrived in Toulouse Saturday afternoon and was met by Crispin.
After an hour and a half drive we arrived at the farmhouse. The rest
of Saturday was spend reassembling my bike, buying provisions at the
Shopi (small supermarket) in the next village and waiting for the rest
of the group (they were all men, none of whom I'd met before) to
arrive. I noticed that the bells of the village church, which was just
a couple buildings from the farmhouse, would ring out the time. Three
bells for 3:00pm, how quaint I thought. </p>

<p> When everyone had arrived, they all went out to dinner in a nearby
restaurant. I'd signed up for the meal plan and had pasta with
mushroom sauce, which was quite good. But it was very quiet, and I
began to wish I'd gone to dinner with the guys. However I was tired
since I'd gotten up early to get my flight, and I went to bed a bit
early.  And then I discovered that the church bells didn't stop
ringing at night. I had an uninterrupted line of sight (and sound)
from my window to the church tower. I'm a light sleeper, and the
church bells woke me up many times during the night during my stay in
the farmhouse.  Luckily, we didn't have to get up early in the
mornings, and staying in bed for much longer than usual helped to
compensate for the constantly interrupted sleep. I was plenty wide
awake during the days. </p>

<p> <b>Sunday</b> morning Steve told us of the plan for the day: we
would go to the nearby ski resort town of Luchon via Land Rover and
take the ski lift to the top of the mountain, and then do a mostly
downhill ride to get back down. Aften making lunches (baguettes
stuffed with cheeses and meats, bananas, chocolate) we loaded up and
set off.

The ski lift ride up was amusing, and we got off at the top
in the clouds. We all pulled on our jackets: while it was about 24
degrees Celsius in the valley, it was 14 on the top of the mountain,
according to my trusty Cateye computer with built-in thermometer.
After Steve's disclaimer ("You are responsible for your own
riding. Don't do anything you don't feel comfortable with.") we set
off. Steve lead us along, and Crispin brought up the rear. The trails
were mixed: single track, double track and dirt road, with a couple of
longish climbs mixed in with the downhill. At the beginning of each
section of trail, Steve would explain what was coming up, and would
warn us of any special hazards. He would also give technical hints for
how to deal with them. This helped a great deal. </p>

<p> On that first day I seem to remember spending an awful lots of
time flying down reasonably smooth dirt roads. This was fun, but not
particularly challenging. The best part of the riding was a bit just
near the end, where we did some tricky singletrack on the side of a
hill. To the right was a bank, and to the left the hill fell away from
the track steeply. I used to be very nervous about these sorts of
situations, worrying too much about the dropoff, and consequently
going very slowly. My confidence has increased now, and I was going
about the same speed as I would on level ground. It required a great
deal of concentration, and I enjoyed the challenge. However, this
track gave us our first bike injury: one of the guys (Alan) crashed and
warped the front wheel of his new Cannondale beyond repair. After this
great bit of track we were at the bottom, and we had a short ride on
the road back to Luchon, where we settled down for beer, about 16 miles
after getting off the ski lift. </p>

<p> After a rest Crispin suggested riding on the road back to the
farmhouse, about a 14 mile trip along the valley floor, and I quickly
took him up on it: I'd felt that the day's riding was too easy. A few
other people decided to do it as well, and we headed off. Crispin
tried to organize a pace line, but a couple of the guys were too tired
to keep up.  Crispin wanted to try to beat the Land Rover back, so he
asked the slower guys if they were OK to make it back on their own,
and they agreed. So the three of us remaining took off. I discovered
then that there was a headwind, so even though the road was slightly
downhill on average, being at the front required a fair bit of
effort. Still, we were rolling along at 19 or 20mph, and it was alot
of fun. We did indeed beat the Land Rover Back. I learned that Alan
had found a bike shop open and gotten a new wheel, so he was ready to
roll again. </p>

<p> We washed our bikes (with a good high-pressure hose and car brush)
and ourselves (in a clean shower stall with all the hot water we
wanted). That evening I went out with the guys to dinner, since Brenda
didn't object to me going off the meal plan. We went to the Hotel Le
Terminus in the nearby village, where we had tasty four course meals
for 10 quid. </p>

<p> On <b>Monday</b> we did a 16 mile cross country loop, guided by
Steve, Brenda, and Crispin. It was a cool (about 15 C for most of the
day) cloudy day with occasional light rain. We started from the base,
rode around the valley for a couple of miles to warm up, then climbed
up up up on a dirt road. The guides showed their fitness by zipping up
the hill far quicker than any of the guests. Then lots of singletrack
riding, technical ups and downs, including some steep rocky uphills
that I couldn't do (nor could any of the other guests), but which
Steve rode straight up. We had lunch at a ruined chateau. A quick
climb up the rebuilt tower provided a great view of the surrounding
area. </p>

<p> On <b>Tuesday</b> we had a hard ride in every sense. We were to
start the day's off-road riding at the La Mourtis ski station, and we
had two choices as to how to get up there: ride or Land Rover. The
ride would involve a 9 mile ride to the base of the climb, and then a
6 mile climb up the Col de Mente, a Tour de France climb. Most of the
guys decided that they'd do the initial 9 miles by bike, then wait in
a cafe for the Land Rover to take them up the hill. I and three others
decided that we would ride up, and Crispin accompanied us, or to be
more accurate, shot past us and arrived at the top long before any of
us did. I was about in the middle of the group doing the climb. I
started off in a short-sleeve shirt and shorts, but as we climbed it
got colder. As I hit the bottom edge of the clouds, I stopped to put
my jacket on, and Jason, who'd been not too far behind me during most
of the climb, came within talking distance. Feeling a bit competitive,
I wanted to stay in front of him, so I didn't let him catch up to me.
The Land Rover passed and checked that that we were doing OK. I waved
them on. Finally, the end was in sight: out of the mist came vague
shapes of the Land Rover and cyclists. I heard a noise close behind
me. It was Jason shifting gears. I shifted up myself and poured on all
the power I had left, but it wasn't enough. Jason pulled past and beat
me to the top. Oh well. </p>

<p> It was quite cold at the top. It had been something like 16
degrees (Celsius) in the valley, but it was 7 degrees at the top. We
all crawled into the Land Rover for shelter as we ate lunch, and then
we pulled on all the warm clothes we had for the ride down. I was very
grateful for Steve's suggestion that we bring lots of layers
with us. I put on some thin long cycle tights, a thermal shirt under
my jacket, and glove liners. I was just about warm enough. </p>

<p> I found that I had slowed down on the downhills. Or maybe the
other guys were going faster. In the previous couple of days I'd been
one of the first riders both up and down hills. That day I was still
among the first up (even after the big climb), but more and more of
the guys were going downhill faster than I was. By the time the day
was up, about half of them were going down faster than I was. I
figured it was a combination of them getting more used to their bikes
(and thus gaining confidence) and the fact that I was tired from the
climb and thus being more cautious. And then there's the fact that I'm
not a particularly fast downhiller to begin with... As I said to
Crispin on the day he picked me up from the airport "My method of
going downhills is to get my bum back off the saddle and use lots of
brake". </p>

<p> And these downhills were indeed challenging. There was one long
stretch of steep muddy dirt road, with copious ruts and bumps. It was
a challenge to stay upright here. At one point I was riding behind
Alan, and I saw the most amazing crash. He was riding on the right
side of the track, near the dropoff. He lost control of the bike and
fell onto the track. Somehow his bike flew in the air and down the
dropoff. I went along the left edge, cautiously as always, and around
the hairpin turn. Alan went down the bank to collect his bike, and
happily it looked all right. However, later he reported that the pedal
was bent, so if he clicked into it it twisted his foot around
uncomfortably, so he ride without clipping in and was very careful
going down the hills. After a closer inspection of the bike further
down the slopes, he found that it was his crank that was bent, not the
pedal. Ooops. </p>

<p> Another part involved going down a steepish section that had a
surface of embedded rocks. They were slightly muddy from the rain, and
I went very slowly. The bike slipped out from under me a couple of
times. The first time I caught myself with my foot, but the second
time it happened too fast, and I crashed. Luckily, I'm good at
crashing. I don't put out my arms and try to stop myself, I just go
limp and let myself roll, or slide, or whatever. I picked myself
straight up and got the bike out of the way. However the people behind
me had stopped, and they let me get going again rather than going
around me. </p>

<p> Finally we were at the bottom of the climb, where most of the
group settled in for a beer or two at a cafe while the guides went for
the Land Rover they'd left up the top. The idea was that when they
returned back, they would drive us back to the base. But to me the
idea of going back 9 miles on a slightly downhill smooth road by Land
Rover seemed silly.  So I rode back, as did another guy, Douglas, who
had also ridden up the Col de Mente.  When I got off the bike I found
I had absolutely no energy. My legs ached incredibly, and I didn't
feel like doing anything. I just sat on a bench and looked at the
mountains and the sky for awhile.  Finally I had recovered some, so I
washed my bike and myself and made a cheese sandwich to curb my
hunger. </p>

<p> On <b>Wednesday</b> most of the guys had to leave early, so only
two of us, Douglas and I went out for a ride. I think Douglas was even
more wiped out by the previous day's riding than I was, since he
seemed to be struggling a bit. We had a gentle 11 mile cross country
ride, with no major uphills or downhills, although there was some
technical stuff with a fair bit of mud. The weather was sunny and
warm, and for the first time on the trip I was cycling in a short
sleeve shirt and shorts. We went for a ride around the village of of
St Bertrand de Comminges. Steve said had a very interesting wooden
cathedral, but we only saw it from the outside (we wouldn't be allowed
in with bike clothes). After we got back I cleaned up myself and the
bike, packed up, and left. </p>

<p> It was a great holiday. </p>
