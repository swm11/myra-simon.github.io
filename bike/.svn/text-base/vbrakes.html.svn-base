<h2 align="center">Adjusting/Changing Pads on XT and XTR V-brakes</h2>
<h2 align="center">Patty Ciesla</h2>

<p> V-Brake ladies and gents: The following is for fine-tuning Shimano XT or
XTR V-brakes and levers when you replace the pads and want to dial your
brakes in. I set up my V-brakes by first screwing in the barrel adjuster
all the way (but one turn) at the levers to make it easier to adjust them
out when the pads wear. My final adjustment is also at the barrel for how
much pull I want; and as my pads wear I may adjust them frequently. Usually
I twist them out one or two turns after a wet/long ride has removed some
brake pad.</p> 

<p> I set up lever pull for my short fingers by screwing the set-screw on the
front-top of the black lever housing (tiny little 2 mm allen, I think) in
all the way, to keep the levers from moving so far away from the bar. I
also take out one of the two plastic blocks in the lever itself (where the
cable comes in) to reduce the amount of cable the lever pulls and make the
brakes a little less grabby. I don't weigh much, so I don't need the
mega-strong brake action of lots of cable pull like a clydesdale might.</p> 

<p> Assuming the pad was adjusted correctly at the rim (you didn't rearrange
the semi-spherical washers that hold the pad assembly to the parallel push
mechanism did you? they are slightly different thicknesses so you can swap
them around and set up the brakes on different width rims; if you don't put
them back right, usually the adjustment will be all screwed up), you
shouldn't have to adjust anything at the brake itself just because you put
on new pads. That assumes the old ones were set up right and wore evenly.
If they were not evenly worn and you adjusted them for toe-in, the new pads
won't contact the rim squarely. Pads are easy to replace by pulling the
cotter pin out with needle nose pliers, sliding old pad off, new pad in,
and then looking through the cotter hole to make sure you can get the pin
through before you start trying to put the cotter pin back in. A drop of
tri-flow on the pin and a test for angle without the pad in may help you
get the cotter through the lower hole. Be careful twisting the cotter, you
can break the top off. XTR pads come packaged with new cotters, BTW.</p> 

<p> Sometimes as the brakes get older, things get sloppy and they need
adjustment. Use the allen on the nut on the side of the brake, where the
pin from the pad assembly goes through the parallel push assembly next to
the brake arm. Loosen the nut, push the brake arm in until the pad contacts
the rim. Pushing the pad against the rim holds it in place while the nut is
loose and makes adjustment really easy. Move the pad around until it is
centered up-down on the braking surface of the rim and the contour on top
follows the curve of the rim. Look at the brake from the front (or rear)
and line up the pin on the pad assembly to be at right angles to the rim,
not angled up or down. Tighten the nut firmly. Repeat on the other side,
but check that both brakes match when you're done. Spin your tire and make
sure it doesn't rub against the cotter pin holding in the brake pad. If it
does, it will cut your tire wall and cause a blow-out. Check by pulling the
levers as the wheel spins. Make sure the pad doesn't dive down towards the
spokes either. If the pad moves on the rim, you probably don't have the pin
at right angles to the braking surface.</p> 

<p> When I put new pads on, they rub, because they are thicker than the old
ones and I also took the slack out of the cable at the lever. I loosen the
cable clamp at the brake, let it out about 5-10 mm, tighten the clamp
again. This is the gross cable adjustment procedure I do first to try to
get the clearance at the pads roughly right (check lever pull). Then, now
here's the trick, there are two little tiny screws down near the pivot
where the brake arms attach to the frame (or fork), that you screw IN to
move the pad away from the rim. There's also a wire spring that pushes out
against a pin, to move the pads away from the rim when you let go of the
levers. Sometimes I pull the springs out from the pin and add a little
tweak to make them stronger, and make sure both springs pull equally, then
stick them back. Make sure the arms of the brakes are roughly parallel with
each other, and point straight up, so that your brakes aren't offset to one
side. Then, adjust the little tiny screws so your pads don't rub. Don't use
these screws for major adjustments to pad clearance, use the barrel
adjuster or cable clamp for that. </p> 

<p> Last thing: check the aluminum noodle cable housing where it fits into the
bracket at the brake lever. Make sure the noodle is fully seated in the
bracket. If it's not fit in its spot properly, it will pull an extra 2-3 mm
of cable and make your pads rub even if they were properly adjusted. This
happens to me occasionally after I take the front wheel off for mounting on
the car and am careless putting it back.</p> 

<p> Really last thing: Older V brakes develop slop which can be lessened to a
certain extent by inserting some special shims into the joint between the
brake arm and parallel push assembly. These shims are either free (at your
friendly local bike shop) or cost about 4 bucks. They come with
instructions that are easy to follow, but you will need to remove your
brakes from the bike to get at one screw and peel a sticker off that hides
another. Count on taking your time with this project.</p>
