<p> This weekend we (the Cambridge University Cycling Club) went to
Wales, which has hills. Lots of them, and steep ones too. Fantastic
scenery as well. And challenging tracks (plenty of rocks and roots and
stuff). So it has everything that Cambridge doesn't... </p>

<p> We went up in four vehicles. Darren and Celia, who'd been there many
times before, went up on Thursday evening. The rest of us (Kate, Jez,
Andrea, Cory, Steve, Tim, Myra, Simon, Chris and Bart) went up in two
Land Rovers and a rental car on Friday evening. Kate, who piloted the
rental car, drove like a maniac and got us there in 4 hours, while the
Land Rovers, which can't go very fast even if you want them to, got in
a couple of hours later. </p>

<p> We stayed at a farm. The owner (whose name is Chris King!) is quite a
character. His main hobby is playing the organ, this amazing Yamaha
monstrosity with two keyboards. He has two barns done up to rent out
to people. The "upper barn", where Darren and Celia stayed, was one
big room with a double bed, two bunk beds, a kitchen area, table, and
some couches. The "lower barn", where the rest of us stayed, had two
rooms: a big one with 6 bunk beds (sleeping space for 12 people!),
and a smaller one with kitchen area and table. </p>

<p> The first day we rode around the Betws-Y-Coed forest and did the
Karrimor trail. Basically, the trail is a fair bit of specially-built
singletrack with lots of technical bits connecting together long
stretches of fire road. It was 16 miles and very hilly. It was quite
challenging for my gradient-starved legs. The trail was in
surprisingly good shape considering how much rain Wales has had
recently. (There have been reports of lots of floods in south Wales).
The only mechanical was a puncture by Simon, and the only crash was
Jez, who'd tried to ride up a very steep bank (and after a couple of
tries, he did it too!). </p>

<p> As we drove back to the farm from the forest, one of the Land Rovers
broke down. The rest of us made it back to the farm and had showers
and dinner. Many packages of pasta and jars of sauce went down the
gullets of the hungry bikers. Saturday night saw us hitting the genteel
(until a bunch of 'foreigners' arrived) town of Barmouth where we
manged to find a pub containing a disco in a cupboard. Plus a midnight
stroll (in gale force winds) along the beach prepared us for the next
day... </p>

<p> The second day Jez and Andrea returned to Cambridge with the help
of the RAC. Myra volunteered to go back with Darren & Celia in order
to help relieve the space crunch caused by one fewer vehicle. Myra
reports: We parked in Barmouth and went for a ride along the estuary,
both on the smooth flat path along the edge and some quite technical
tracks up in the surrounding hills.  It was mostly sunny, and we went
without jacket for most of the ride.  We got done with our ride at
about 4, having gone about 26 miles, but with much less up and down
than the previous day. We packed it up and got back to Cambridge at
10pm. </p>

</table>  

<p> Kate reports: The rest of the group (now reduced to 7!) headed up
to Beddgelert where we developed a 'give & take' relationship with our
bikes. We probably carried our bikes as much as they carried us. But
we were never lost due to Mr Gadget's (Chris) GPS!  Once actually
riding our bikes we climbed up into the forest for ages and then
bascially downhilled manically, some of us under the influence of
Power snot (PowerBar Gel stuff). It was ace. </p>
