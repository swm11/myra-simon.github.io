<h2>Ozzie Biking: The Blue Mountains </h2>

<p> The Blue Mountains are located to the west of Sydney, Australia. It
consists of a high plateau cut deeply by several valleys. The edges of
the plateau are pretty steep, with cliffs at the top of the slope, and
most of the paths that go between the valleys and the plateau make use
of steps. </p>

<p> Simon and I wanted to spend a day mountain biking in the Blue
Mountains, but as we were travelling around Austrailia for a month and
would only be spending a day or two on bikes we brought along only the
essentials: bike shorts, some tools, one water bottle (we'd carry
extra water in rucksacks), and gloves. </p>

<p> We hired bikes from Mountain Designs on Katoomba's main street. The
bikes were Giant Iguanas, rigid cromo bikes with STX/Alivio
drivetrain, Dia-Compe V-brakes, and toe clips. We could have gotten
Specialized Hardrocks with basic Rock Shox forks from another store
(CycleTech), but they were about twice the price. We picked up our
bikes soon after the store opened. Gareth, who organized the rental
bikes for us, suggested the following route: go along the road to
Blackheath, down Megalong Road, take the Six Foot Track to the
suspension bridge crossing Cox's River, then turn around and take the
Six Foot Track all the way back up the plateau (the last bit of which
would involve 300 steps), then along roads back to Katoomba. He
thought this would be a good day-long trip, and we agreed. As we left,
Gareth asked if we were definitely going to do that route. We affirmed
it. He said, "Good, so if you're back late, we'll tell the rescue
services where to look for you". </p>

 <p> We headed out. It was cool, and Simon wore his walking trousers over
his bike shorts, and I had on tights and a jacket. First we went west
along the Great Western Highway, the main road through this part of
the Blue Mountains. It had one lane (occasionally two) in each
direction and was smoothly surfaced and somewhat hilly. Although there
was some traffic, the drivers were polite and passed us safely. At the
town of Medlow Bath the highway turns right and passes over the
railway line. We went straight here, along a dirt road that parallels
the main road. This provided a pleasant car-free ride to Blackheath,
and even a bit of technical challenge, as a section of a downhill had
been badly eroded by water. </p>

<p> In Blackheath we turned left onto Shipley Road and then to Megalong
Road, which follows a creek down off the plateau. We went down for
what seemed like a very long time, enjoying the woosh of the wind. We
stopped a couple of times to do some sightseeing. First was a little
glade and waterfall (Mermaid's Cave, the sign said, but we didn't find
any cave), then a bit of rainforest. Finally we were in the bottom of
the valley. It was warming up, but it still wasn't quite warm enough
for me to take off my jacket and tights.

<p> There were some farms in the valley, several with horses. Evidently
horseriding is a popular activity here. We found a little tea place
and stopped there, sitting on the picnic table outside. We ordered a
big pot of tea and ate our packed lunch (sandwiches and fruit buns)
furtively as we waited for it to cool. We had gone through the water
bottle by then, so we refilled it and headed off. </p>

<p> We came to the Six Foot Track soon after the road crossed Megalong
Creek and the tarmac turned to dirt. We turned right, towards the
suspension bridge. We finally felt warm enough to strip down to
T-shirt and shorts. </p>

<p> At first the track was a wide dirt road, but then it crossed a couple
of fields and became nice singletrack. There were plenty of rocks and
roots, and lots of little ups and downs, though on the whole there was
more down than up. I was immensely pleased: how I miss technical
riding living around Cambridge! There were even some steps, which we,
playing safe, dismounted for. We stopped often to take pictures,
admire the view, and drink water. </p>

<p> Eventually, we reached the suspension bridge. It was very narrow, and
a sign said that only one person was allowed on the bridge at a
time. There was a party of walkers going over the bridge, and the last
two were about to make their way across. They asked "How do you get
the bikes across?" I answered, "We don't; we turn around and go
back". And, after eating a couple of cereal bars and drinking more
water, we did exactly that. </p>

<p> We were starting to get worried about the time. It was now a bit after
3pm. The shop closed at 5:30, although Gareth said that there was
usually someone around until 6. A harder deadline was that it would be
dark by 6pm, and all we had for lights was one Mini Maglight torch. We
kept it moving, rolling swiftly over the parts we could ride, and
pushing or carrying the bikes over the stuff we couldn't. We made good
time, and soon we came out of the trees and saw, far away, the cliff
that we'd have to get the bikes up. We got back to Megalong Road by a
bit after 4pm. We were hopeful that we might make it back in time. We
were even more hopeful when we found that the Six Foot Track on the
other side of Megalong Road was mostly flat and smooth: no technical
bits or stairs to slow us down. It soon became a fire road, and we
were going even faster, and the cliff got closer and closer. </p>

<p> And then, we went slower, as the road started going up and got
narrower. Before too long it was too steep to ride, at least in our
tired state. We pushed the bikes. Then the track got rougher, and we
had to lift the bike over the occasoinal rocks, and then we had to
carry them over clusters of rocks. It was past 5, and the light was
beginning to fade. We knew we wouldn't make it back before the shop
closed. </p>

<p> We were already pretty tired by the time we reached the first step. It
was about a foot high, formed by dirt banked against a log that formed
the edge of the step. We looked at it, knowing that there were many
more like it to come. I got out the camera to take a picture, but it
was too dark, and I hadn't brought a flash. I put it away and got out
my jacket. No, not to wear, I knew I'd be working up a sweat carrying
the bike. I wanted it for a shoulder pad. I bent down and hoisted the
bike up. I started up, followed by Simon, who had similarly arranged
his bike. </p>

<p> I soon found that slow and steady was by far the best way to go. If I
went too fast I'd get out of breath, and then I'd have to stop. And of
course, I'd put the bike down. And then when I got going I'd have to
wrangle it back onto my shoulder. If I went slowly I could continue up
without stopping. Simon found that he couldn't carry the bike on his
shoulder; it kept slipping off. So he ended up picking the bike by the
seat tube, carrying it up a bunch of steps, and then stopping to rest. </p>

<p> I think at this point we really appreciated the light hiking boots we
were wearing. Normally we would be wearing cleated cycling shoes, but
we left these (and the matching SPD pedals) at home for lack of space.
The hiking boots gave us a better grip over the rocks and logs that we
were walking up, so maybe it worked out for the best after all. </p>

<p> Even with the jacket padding my shoulder, the bike still pressed
heavily onto it. I found that if I grabbed the bottom edge of the big
chainring with my right hand (the gloves protecting my fingers from
the teeth), my arm was completely extended, and so I could support the
bike using little additional muscle power. I grabbed the down tube
with my left hand to further take the weight off my shoulder.  And so
I went. Step, pause, step, pause, step, pause, all in slow motion. </p>

<p> We heard a helicopter. I got really nervous: are they looking for us?
Maybe the guys at Mountain Designs, noting that we hadn't gotten back
before closing time, had called out mountain rescue on us! After I'd
fretted for a bit, the helicopter went away. But now were they looking
for us down in the valley? </p>

<p> The tops of the trees got nearer and nearer as the last of the light
faded from the sky. Both of us would have enjoyed stopping for a rest,
but we wanted to make it to the top before it got completely dark. So
we continued on. Step, pause, step, pause for me. Step step step
step step step, stop and rest for Simon. </p>

<p> Finally we were at the top. It was dark. We stopped, ate the last
of our cereal bars, and drank the last of our water. We went on,
relying mostly on ambient light to guide the way as we went along a
fire road towards the Great Western Highway. Luckily the track was a
very light colored, sandy dirt. We pushed the bikes up a couple of the
steepest and loosest bits, and then we were back at the road. Simon
got out his Mini Maglite and pointed it ahead. We stayed on the
shoulder and were very glad when we got to the streetlights on the
edge of Katoomba. We vowed that the next time we go travelling and
plan to rent bikes, we'll bring along some lights. </p>

<p> We weren't on the main road long. We turned off and went into town by
less travelled roads. Or rather, we tried to go into town via less
travelled roads. We should have stopped to look at our map, but I
thought I remembered the way. So we rode on. And on. Finally, still
finding ourselves on the outskirts of town, we stopped a passing van
to ask directions to the center. "You're going the wrong way, mate!"
we were told. Oh well. We reversed course and were soon back to the
main street.  </p>

<p> It was past seven now, and the shop had long closed. We went to the
youth hostel where we were staying. We were still concerned that the
mountain rescue squad was out looking for us, so we had the guy at the
desk phone around. No, they hadn't been told about us, so we took a
shower and ate dinner with much lighter hearts. </p>

<p> We were there with the bikes the next morning when the shop opened,
and they were nice and didn't charge us extra for keeping them out
overnight. When we asked Gareth about the mountain rescue, he said
that he'd looked for us on the road as he drove home, but thought that
we looked reasonably responsible, and we'd be all right. </p>

<p> Statistics. Time: about 9 hours, including all stops. Distance: about
40km in total, divided as follows. 10km on paved and dirt road to get
to Blackheath, 10km mostly downhill on Megalong Road, 4km to 5km on
the Six Foot Track to get to the suspension bridge, and then back
along this section, about 6km to get back to the road along the Six
Foot Track, then maybe 6km as we wandered around random roads trying
to find the town center. </p>
