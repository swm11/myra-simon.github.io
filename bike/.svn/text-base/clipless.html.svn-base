<p> (Just in case you've been in a cave for the last decade, clipless
pedals require you to screw a metal or plastic "cleat" to the bottom
of your shoes, which have been specially designed for this. These
cleats attach to special receptors on the pedal. You usually have to
twist your foot to get your feet unattached from the pedals.)

<p> I have had clipless pedals (SPD or SPD-compatible ones) on my
touring bike since the autumn of 1994, and I installed them on all my
other bikes the summer of 1997.  Yes, I'm a big fan. Here are the
reasons why. </p>

<p> Clipless pedals allow you to perfect your <a
href="pstroke.html">spin</a>. To pedal your bike most efficiently, you
need to apply pressure more smoothly around the pedal stroke instead
of just pushing down. The best way to do this is to pull back on the
pedals at the bottom of the stroke. If you do this with toe clips,
unless you've got them dangerously tight, you'll often come out of the
toe clips. </p>

<p> Clipless pedals allow you to get quickly attached to the pedals,
epecially if you get SPD-style pedals that have attachment mechanisms
on both side of the pedal. With these you can often get attached just
by stomping on the pedal. If this doesn't work, wiggling your foot
around a bit is sufficient to get it on. This is most useful for
commuting in traffic and for mountain biking. For commuting, you want
to get attached to your pedals as quickly as possible after the light
turns green, so you can accelerate better and have better control of
your bike. When you're starting from a stop on a mountain bike,
especially going uphill, sometimes you're going too slowly to pause to
flip a pedal with toe clips around. So you end up going up the hill
with your foot on the (usualy somewhat slippery) underside of your
pedal, with the clip often dragging the ground. </p>

<p> Clipless pedals give you much more control of the bike, especially
off-road. If you have toe clips you have to keep them reasonably loose
so you can get out quickly. But then you sometimes get jolted out of
them on rough terrain. With clipless pedals your feet are attached
much more securely, and your feet rarely come out when you don't want
them to. Yet, once you get used to rotating your heels out to release
them, you come out easily when you want to. Also, when you crash you
naturally come out. At least, I do. You do hear of a few cases where
people found themselves still attached to the bike after a crash, but
these are rare. Generally, during a crash your body naturally twists
itself sufficiently to release you. </p>

<p> Another reason to go clipless: winter riding. One way to keep your
feet warm on rides of 40 degrees F (~5C) or below is to wear neoprene
booties. But the booties don't fit into toe clips very well. You can
stuff them in, but it cuts off your circulation, which results in very
cold feet. With clipless pedals, you cut a little hole out of the sole
of your booties, and then you clip on just as well as before. It
really does make a difference. Before, my toes would get dangerously
cold. Now I can ride in weather down to freezing, and my feet are
plenty warm with the booties (coupled with fleece socks under my
shoes). If I add some chemical heating pads in the toes my toes will
be warm in any weather. Once I was out in 24F degree (-5C) weather,
with wind chills to 0F (-15C) or so, and my feet were fine. (Check out
other cold-weather riding tips <a href="cold.html">here</a>). </p>

<p> The biggest problem with SPD-compatible pedals on the road is foot
pain. The area of contact on the SPDs is smaller than LOOK-type
clipless pedals, and much smaller than with toe clips. Unless you have
very stiff shoes to distribute the pressure, it can cause you real
pain on longer rides. A good portion of my friends who have
SPD-compatible pedals have had this problem, and I do to some degree
as well. Happily the problem is easily curable by getting new, better
shoes. Unfortunately, these better shoes cost alot more. So if you get
cheap SPD-compatible shoes, be warned that you may soon have to shell
out more for better shoes later. If you think you'll be doing longer
rides (maybe 40 miles or more) it's best to get good stiff shoes to
begin with. If you're unsure about how stiff the shoes need to be,
talk to the people in the shop and mention that you're worried about
foot pain, and they'll steer you clear of the flexible ones.</p>

<p> The biggest problem with SPD-compatible pedals off-road is mud.
Whenever you stop, try to put your foot down on a grassy area, and
whipe your feet off on the grass before you get back on the bike.
This works reasonably well to keep them from getting too packed with
mud. But sometimes you have to put you foot down in mud, so it help to
keep a stick or some keys handy to clean the mud off your cleats if it
gets jammed up.

<h4>Kinds of clipless pedals</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> SPD stands for Shimano Pedalling Dynamics, so only Shimano makes
proper SPD pedals. At the top of the page is a picture of the most
popular Shimano pedal. They make other ones, more expensive ones and
ones with cages around them, but this one is reasonably priced and
works well, so most people go for this.  SPD-type pedals have the
advantage that the cleats are small and fit into a little pocket in
the bottom of your shoes, and the tread of the shoes extends a bit
beyond the cleat, so you can walk reasonably normally in the
shoes. Also, they usually have attachment mechanisms on both sides of
the pedal, making it very easy to get your shoe clipped into the
pedal. These types of pedals are used by commuters, mountain bikers,
and touring-type road riders. </p>

<p> There are many companies that make pedals with a very similar
mechanism (for example, VP and Ritchey). Some people think that these
SPD-clones aren't as good as the originals, a few people think that
they are better. Often they are less expensive than the real Shimano
versions. </p>

<p> There are some pedals that use the same general idea as SPD pedals
(small cleat that fits in a pocket in your shoe), but have entirely
different shaped cleats and entirely different sorts of release
mechanisms in the pedals. These pedals include Speedplay (which have
loads of float, see below) and Time ATAC (which are said to be better
in mud than SPD pedals). </p>

<p> Road riders who are interested only in speed tend to go for pedals
with a very different sort of cleat and pedal.  Generally, the cleats
are much larger and the soles of the shoes are flat, so you can hardly
walk in them at all. They also take more time to get attached to
as the pedals have the attachment mechanism only on one side. You have
to swing the pedal around with yout foot before you can clip in.
Supposedly they are more efficient, but as I have never used them I
can't say much about them. There must be something to the claim, since
they are very popular with road racers.  The company best known for
these types of pedals is <a
href="http://www.lookcyclesusa.com/pedals.htm">LOOK</a>, so the
pedals are often known as LOOK-type (as opposed to SPD-type). </p>

<h4>Float</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Float means this: when you have your foot attached to the pedal,
you can rotate your shoes a bit with little resistance. Of course, if
you rotate far enough, you'll release the pedals. A moderate amount of
float is good for your knees, as it allows your feet to turn a bit as
you pedal, which they tend to do naturally. Most SPD-type pedals today
come with something like 5 degrees of float, which is certainly enough
for me. With LOOK-type pedals, you use different cleats to give you
different amounts of float. For example, with proper LOOK pedals, the
black cleats have no float but the red ones have 7 degrees. </p>
