<h2>Thetford Forest</h2>

<p> The flatlands of East Anglia are not known for the great mountain
biking to be had there, but there are some nice places to go. One of
them is Thetford Forest. It is indeed flat, but has lots of fun twisty
tracks. Also, the soil is very sandy, so it drains well and is
ridable even after a good rain. There's good enough riding that some
serious races (like recently one from the Rav4 series) take place
there. </p>

<p> If you go there, your first stop should be the Forest Lodge, which
has loos, a little cafe, and an ice cream stand. It is located on the
B1107 between Brandon and Thetford.  There's a one-way road you go on
to get to the lodge. This road leaves the B1107 near Brandon and
rejoins it near Thetford. </p>
 
<p> It costs 2 quid-something to park. Go to the Lodge and pay 50p for
the "Cycling in the Forest" pamphlet. It will show you all the forest
tracts between the B1107, B1106, and A11, and the fire roads the go
between them. The tract number on the map is written on the corner
trees. This is how you find your way around in the forest. </p>
 
<p> There's lots of good singletrack in amongst the trees. Ride along
a fire road, look for any path going off into the woods, and follow
it!  Here's how to get to my favorite track: Find fire road 10 on your
map. There's a little car park where it meets the B1106. If you head
away from the B1106 (towards B1107), you'll see a little track heading
off to your left after a bit. Follow it. Eventually you'll come to a
bombhole. Go to the other side of the bombhole and follow the track
there. Soon you're in "Swoopy" the closest thing to a roller-coaster
for bikes! </p>
 
<p> There are lots of other tracks in that area, but it's too hard to
describe where they are. I tend to roll around looking for openings in
the woods. </p>
