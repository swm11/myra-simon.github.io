separate battery. It's not about specific systems, although it does
use specific lights as examples. It's intended as a discussion of the
ingredients in a typical lighting system, and it should help you make
up your mind about what you might like to look for in a system. </p>

<a name="brightness"><h2>How Bright are Your Lights?</h2></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Most of the better bike headlight systems nowadays are based on
halogen bulbs. The only ones that aren't are systems like the 
<a href="http://www.cateye.com/MAIN.HTML">Cateye Stadium Light</a>
which are based on Metal Halide Arc bulbs. These very exotic and
expensive systems won't be covered here. For
information on this technology, see 
<a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/marty_light_hist.html"> Marty
Goodman's article</a>.</p>

<p> So assuming we're sticking to halogen bulbs, what determines how
bright your light is? Or, perhaps a better question is: what determines
how useful your lights are?</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="wattage"><h4>Wattage</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> The most obvious way to quantify how much useful light you get
from a light is the amount of power consumed by the bulb, which is
measured in watts (abbreviated W). By and large, the more power
consumed, the brighter the light.  Very generally speaking, 2W to 3W
is good for commuting in lit areas, maybe 5W to 6W is needed for
riding on the road in unlit areas (although people typically use
anywhere between 2W and 15W depending on their needs), and 10W or more
is needed for off-road riding at night (although perhaps you can get
by with as little as 6W). However, there are many variables that need
to be taken into consideration.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="pattern"><h4>Beam shape/pattern</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> If the light is put in the wrong place (has the wrong shape), it's
not any good. For example, the old Specialized Preview Plus (5W)
lights put out a very wide light that had very little depth to it.
For road use, it allowed a good view of the edge of the road, but
wasn't very good at showing you what was on the road itself. It was
useless for riding off-road, since it illuminated very little of the
trail. I find that I prefer a round patch of light, such as is
provided by MR-11 bulbs.</p>

<p> Does the beam have a good pattern? Is the light distributed
smoothly, or are there bars or bands of lighter/darker patches in the
beam? For example, the old VistaLite 400 lighting head has dark rings in
its beam when used with normal (clear) bulbs. (To compensate for this,
VistaLite frosted the 10W bulbs provided with its 420 and 430 lighting
systems, but this tended to scatter the light in all directions,
putting less light where you want it. Backyard side-by-side tests with
a 6W clear bulb and a 10W frosted demonstrate that the 6W bulb
provided about the same amount of usable light as the 10W bulb.) Some
people find that these dark/light bands hide irregularities in the
ground and don't like them. I don't mind them, but this is a matter of
personal preference.</p>

<p> Many bike lighting systems (for example, 
<a href="http://www.vistalite.com/01code25.html">VistaLite
Nightstick</a> series, all
<a href="http://www.niterider.com/products.html">NiteRider</a>
bike lighting systems, and 
<a href="http://www.cateye.com/product.htm">Cateye</a> Daylite II)
are constructed out of MR-11 bulbs. An MR-11 "bulb" consists of the
actual bulb (light-generating part) and a very good reflector, put
together into a very small (about the same diameter as a 35mm film
can, but shorter) and neat package. Since the bulbs are self-contained
units, the lighting heads that house them only need to provide some
protection and a way of getting power to the bulb; thus they tend to
be small and light.  The bulbs provide a beautifully smooth, round
beam. Typically, there is a brighter patch in the interior (the angle
of this bright patch, be it 10 or 15 degrees or whatever, is what is
meant by the the angle of the bulb, if it is specified) and a much
wider (about 120 degrees) round patch of dimmer light surrounding the
bright patch. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name="overvolting"><h4>Over or under volting</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> This one is more subtle. This
has to do with how much voltage is applied to the bulb, vs how much
voltage the manufacturer expected to be applied to the bulb. To
sum up this angle briefly, if you apply more voltage than the
manufacturer specified (overvolting), then you consume more power and
the bulb burns more brightly, but you get more extra light than extra
power consumption. This is a win, but the downside is that the bulb
burns out more quickly. Conversely, if you apply less voltage than the
manufacturer specified (undervolting), then you consume less power and
the bulb burns dimmer, but you get more of a reduction in light than
reduction in power consumption. The upside is that the bulb life is
lengthened. </p>

<p> For the technically inclined, here is a graph (generously provided by
William Burrow) that shows how the relationship between these
quantities. (For the non-technically inclined, skip to ***.)
It shows how bulb life (Life), the amount of light put out
by the bulb (Luminous flux), and power consumed by the bulb (Power)
vary when different voltages are applied to the bulb.  </p>
</blockquote>

<center><p>
<img src="images/lamplife.gif">
</p></center>

<blockquote>
<p> The horizontal axis is the voltage applied to the bulb, where the
middle of the graph is the voltage recommended by the manufacturer,
the "nominal voltage" (shown as 100%). The vertical axis represents
the variation in the plotted quantities when different voltages are
applied. All the curves cross at the center of the graph (at the 100%
mark on both scales) since the plotted quantities all represent
variations from the normal operating mode (when you apply the nominal
voltage), not actual numbers. So, for example, when you apply 110% of
the nominal voltage, the light output goes up by nearly 40%, but the
power consumption goes up by only about 15%. Thus you're getting more
light for your power.  However, the bulb life is down to about 33%
(1/3) of what it would be if run at the nominal voltage. Since for
some bulbs (notably MR-11s) the bulb life is on the order of thousands
of hours (around 2000) when operated at nominal voltage, this may
very well be a reasonable compromise. At the far right of the scale, at
120% of nominal voltage, we get an even better light/power ratio, but
the bulb life is now 1/10 of what it would be at nominal voltage. This
seems like a good upper limit to the amount you should overvolt
a long-lived bulb.</p>

<p> To see the effect of undervolting, look to the left of 100%. We see
that Luminous flux decreases faster than Power, so you get less
efficient light, but much longer bulb life.</p>

<p> *** Both overvolting and undervolting are used by today's systems.
<a href="http://www.niterider.com/products.html">NiteRider</a>
usually overvolts the bulbs in its current 6V systems; however
older NiteRider bulbs weren't overvolted and are therefore dimmer than
current ones. VistaLite offers overvolted bulbs for its Nightstick series
lighting systems: their H.O.T. (Halogen Overdrive Technology) is
simply overvolting. </p>

<p> Since you get less light for the power consumed, undervolting seems
like a bad idea. That is, unless you want to get several lighting
levels out of one bulb. NiteRider does this with its Digital
systems. For example, the Digital Pro-6 has three power settings with
one bulb. The 15W setting is done by slightly overvolting the
bulb. The 10W setting is done by providing less voltage, probably
slightly undervolting the bulb. The 6W setting results from
undervolting the bulb even more. It's terribly inefficient, but if
you need that low setting to get you home after a long ride, it can be
a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="independence"><h4>Ability to aim lights independently</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> If you have two bulbs of differing power (a high and low beam),
it's useful to be able to point them in different places. Since you'll
use the low beam when you're going slower, it's best to have it
pointed somewhat close to the bike to illuminate the details near
you. You'll use the high beam (or both beams) when you're going
faster, so you'll want to point the high beam further from the bike,
to illuminate the road/trail further ahead. If you have a dual-beam
system where the lights are stuck together with no independent
movement (as in NiteRider dual-beam systems), you don't have this
option. Having completely separate lighting heads (as in the VistaLite
Nightstick systems) or separately aimable bulbs in one mount (as in
the Specialized Fireball systems) does give you this option.</p>

</blockquote>

<a name="batteries"><h2>Batteries</h2></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Next we consider the source of power: the battery. Most batteries
used for bike lighting systems are sealed lead-acid or nickel cadmium
(NiCad) batteries. Some newer systems use Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
batteries, which offer increased energy density and lack cadmium, a
poisonous heavy metal. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name="rechargables"><h4>Why use rechargables at all?</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Most cheap, low-powered lights are designed to be operated with
disposable (e.g. alkaline) batteries, while the better, higher-powered
systems use rechargable batteries. One reason for this is obvious:
since the lights consume alot of power, you'd be spending alot of
money replacing disposable batteries if you used them. There's another
aspect too, which is just as important: the most common kinds of
disposable batteries (alkalines and zinc-carbon batteries) have a high
internal resistance, which means basically that they have difficulty
supplying the high currents that bright lights need. Alkalines can be
used in higher-powered systems, but are best combined with a voltage
regulator (such as the <a
href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/willie/lvr.html">LVR2</a>) and
wired up in such a way that no one cell provides too much
current. Zinc-carbon batteries have even more internal resistance than
alkalines, and thus are nearly useless for lighting applications.</p>

<p> Lithium cells, however, have a very low internal resistance, but they
are very expensive. Randonneurs (cyclists who ride very long
distances at a stretch, going on well into the night and sometimes
overnight) can find disposable battery packs made of these cells
useful. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name="bat-volt"><h4>6 volt vs. 12 volt</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Most systems either use 6V or 12V (or 13.2V) batteries. I usually
refer to batteries with 13.2V as "12V systems", since there isn't that
much difference (the extra cell in the 13.2V system is put there to
overvolt a nominally 12V bulb). </p>

<p> Usually, 12V batteries have higher capacity than 6V batteries.  A
6V NiCad battery will probably be 4.5 to 5 amp-hours, giving you 27 to
30 watt-hours of power. (The capacity in watt-hours allows you to
estimate how long your light will run. Take the wattage of your bulb,
divide the capacity in watt-hours by the wattage, and you have a
theoretical runtime. To make it more accurate multiply by a 0.9 fudge
factor.) A 12V NiCad battery will typically be 2.5 to 3 amp-hours,
giving you 30 to 36 watt-hours of capacity. Commercial NiMH systems
seem to all use 12V batteries, and these have even higher capacities,
going from 44 to 52 watt-hours. </p>

<p> Bulbs for 6V systems are usually available in lower powers (5W to
15W for most systems) than bulbs for 12V systems (8W to 35W, the most
common being 12W and 20W). However, one company, <a
href="http://www.lumicycle.co.uk">Lumicycle</a>, offers 5W bulbs
for its 12V system. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name="bat-type"><h4>Lead-acid vs NiCad batteries vs NiMH</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Lead acid batteries come with the cheapest systems, NiCad
batteries come with more expensive systems, and NiMH batteries come
with the most expensive systems. There is a simple reason for this:
good quality NiCad cells are cost a fair bit of money, and NiMH cells
are even more expensive. The cost of a NiCad or NiMH powered lighting
system is usually dominated by the cost of the battery!</p>

<p> NiCad and NiMH batteries have many desirable characteristics. If
they are treated well, both will outlast lead-acid batteries,
providing more charge/discharge cycles, with NiCad being even better
than NiMH. Lead acid batteries typically last for 200-400 cycles, NiMH
for 300-1000 cycles, and NiCad 300-2000 cycles. For a given capacity,
a NiCad battery will weigh less than a lead-acid battery, and NiMH
will weigh less yet. A 12V 4Ah lead-acid battery weighs just under 2
kilograms, while a 12V 4Ah NiCad battery would weigh about 1200 grams,
while a 12V 4Ah NiMH battery weighs about 720 grams. The main
disadvantages of NiCad and NiMH batteries are their high price and the
fact that they can slowly self-discharge, losing about 1-3% of their
capacity per day. Lead-acid batteries retain very nearly their full
charge over a long period of time (months).</p>

<p> As you are powering your light, the batteries lead-acid batteries
discharge in slightly difference ways. The voltage of a lead-acid
battery drops off with time, gradually dimming your lights. However, a
NiCad or NiMH battery keeps almost the same voltage until it's nearly
exhausted. This aspect of NiCads is both a benefit and a drawback. It
can help you to get more useful energy out of your battery, as your
lights will burn at full power until the battery is close to empty.
However, once your lights start to dim or go yellow, you must turn
them off immediately to avoid damaging the battery. Thus you get
little to no warning when your battery is about to run out of power.</p>

<p> A lead-acid battery has somewhat higher internal resistance than a
NiCad or NiMH (although much less than an alkaline), which means that
it isn't as good as a NiCad or NiMH at supplying large amounts of
current.  However, there is some variation within the brands of
batteries. The
<a href="http://www.hepi.com/monobloc.htm">
Hawker Energy Cyclon</a> batteries
supplied with VistaLite 420 and 430 systems have 
less internal resistance than other types of lead-acid batteries (such
as those provided with the 
<a href="http://www.niterider.com/products/bike_trailrat.html">NiteRider</a>
Trail Rat). The 5 amp-hour Cyclon battery that came with my VistaLite
430 does about the same in powering a 10W bulb as the Trail Rat
battery: they will both allow a 2.5 hour burn time. However, the 
Cyclon does much better at supplying higher currents. According to a 
<a href="http://www.hepi.com/images/sccpgrph.gif">chart</a>
given by Hawker, the battery will supply 15W of power for about 1.5
hours, while NiteRider clearly states (in their <a
href="http://www.niterider.com/techinfo/geninfo_charging.html">
Charging Information</a> page) that if you put a 15W bulb in the Trail
Rat, you will get only about 20 to 30 minutes of run time.</p>

<p> The temperature at which a battery is used affects the available
capacity. If it's cold, the internal resistance of the battery
increases and the chemical reaction slows down, so you get less usable
capacity. This effect is more pronounced with high currents. This
effect is worst with lead-acid batteries, although NiCad and NiMh
batteries suffer from it a bit too. However, if you are using your
batteries in Artic conditions (-20°C or below) you'll need to take try
to protect even NiCad or NiMH batteries from the cold. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name="charging"><h4>Charging</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> The best way to charge a lead-acid battery is with a constant
voltage, while NiCads and NiMH prefer a constant current. Sadly, very
few systems come with good chargers. They come with simple AC/DC
converters that will damage your battery if you leave them plugged in
longer than the instructions say to. The faster the battery is being
charged, the more important it is to unplug it when the charge is
finished. </p>

<p> The best solution is to have a specialty charger for the type of
battery you have. One option is a smart charger. A smart charger
charges at a high rate (via a high constant voltage for lead-acid
batteries, and a high constant current for NiCad and NiMH batteries),
and then when it detects that your battery is full, it switches to
trickle mode, a much lower charge rate that maintains a full battery
(via a lower constant voltage for lead-acid batteries, and a lower
constant current for NiCads). Power Sonic makes a variety of smart
chargers for lead acid batteries, and they are highly recommended. For
example, PSC-12500-A is a charger for 12V 2-10 amp hour lead acid
batteries. <a href="http://www.mouser.com/">Mouser Electronics</a> in
the US sells them, search for "Power Sonic charger". In the UK, you
can get good smart lead-acid chargers from Maplin. </p>

<p> For lead-acid batteries you can either buy a smart charger that
will charge your battery quickly, or you can make (pretty cheaply) an
overnight charger. The latter sort of charger basically charges your
battery at the trickle rate at all times. It will take maybe 8 to 10
hours to charge your battery, but it is absolutely safe for the
battery, and much easier to build if you want to go the D-I-Y
route. See <a href="charger.html">
here</a> for details on how to make your own. </p>

<p> For NiCads and NiMH, the situation is more complex, as a true
trickle charger will take far too long to charge the battery for it to
be practical. A smart charger is the best and safest. However, they
are expensive, so manufacturers almost never include them with their
lighting systems. Instead, they include a simple AC/DC converter that
charges at a modest rate, typically a rate that will charge the
battery in about 14 hours. The problem here is that they don't shut
off when the battery is full, and if you leave the battery plugged in,
you will overcharge it. In NiCad batteries this results in voltage
depression (see the section on Charge memory and discharging batteries
below).  In NiMH batteries, this damages the battery, leading to fewer
charge/discharge cycles. You can make a charger that will charge for a
certain period of time and then switch off. This is somewhat
complicated, and if you have only partly discharged your battery, this
can still result in overcharging. The best way to care for your
batteries is to get a smart charger to use with them. Unfortunately,
there are no off-the-shelf chargers immediately usable for bike
lighting batteries, and so you must either make one from scratch
yourself or modify a charger meant for something else. See <a
href="charger2.html">here</a> to learn how to construct a NiCad bike
battery charger from a power tool charger. See <a
href="charger3.html">here</a> for info on NiMH smart chargers. </p>

<p> A compromise between stupid AC/DC converter and specialty chargers
are provided by some of the NiteRider systems. The best of these (for
example on the Digital Pro-12) have circuitry that monitors how much
of the battery has been drained while the lights are on, and then when
charging, switches over to trickle mode when just that capacity has
been replaced. Some of the NiteRider systems (such as the Digital
Premium Systems) just charge for a set period of time, then switch to
trickle mode. Both of these chargers are better than plain AC/DC
converters and are worth having, but not all NiteRider systems come
with them. Read the charger information carefully to find out what
kind of charger it comes with before buying a NiteRider system.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="memory"><h4>Charge memory and discharging batteries</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> All rechargable batteries are composed of several cells wired in
series. Lead-acid cells are 2V each, so a 6V battery has 3 cells.
NiCad and NiMH cells are 1.2V each, so a 6V battery has 5 cells. You
should never completely discharge a rechargable battery of any
kind. This can lead to cell reversal. This happens when one cell has
slightly less capacity than the others (a common occurrence due to
small manufacturing variations).  When the capacity of the weaker cell
is exhausted, the other cells continue to happily pump current into it
in the reverse direction, thus destroying the cell. This in turn
destroys your battery, unless you can take it apart to replace the
offending cell.</p>

<p> This is worth repeating: <b>Do not ever completely discharge your
NiCad, NiMH, or lead-acid battery</b>. Once the lights go yellow or
dim, turn them off.</p>

<p> Some people think that NiCad batteries should be completely
discharged now and then to prevent loss of capacity via the "memory"
effect. This is not the case. To explain why, I'll discuss "memory",
and what you can do to avoid it. </p>

<p> Most people think NiCad "memory" comes from recharging your
batteries after only partial discharge. The folk lore is that the
battery somehow "remembers" the smaller capacity that was used, and
only allows you to use this capacity in the future. This is rubbish.
This effect has never been documented in any consumer system, in
certainly not in bike lights.  </p>

<p> However people in the battery industry use the term "memory" to
apply to another phenomena that NiCad batteries do exhibit, which is
more properly called voltage depression. Voltage depression is caused
by overcharging NiCad cells at a slow rate (typically, the rate given
by cheap AC/DC converters provided as chargers by light
manufacturers). Once the battery is charged, the additional energy
being added to the battery is converted into heat, and the heat
changes the crystal structure of nickle and cadmium alloys, producing
a different kind of crystal that produces less voltage than the
desired crystal structure. When the battery is then discharged, the
presence of the bad crystals means that they voltage of the battery is
lower than it ought to be. The result is a somewhat dimmer, more
yellow light, where before they were whiter and brighter. </p>

<p> Please note that voltage depression only results from overcharging
your battery at a low rate. If you overcharging your battery at a high
rate, you will do irreparable damage to the battery. </p>

<p> There are two ways to avoid "memory". (I must admit that I hate
the term memory as applied to voltage depression, because it has
nothing to do with what most people think of a NiCad "memory", and
because the battery isn't "remembering" anything, it has just been
overcharged.) The best way to avoid it is to get a charger that
doesn't overcharge the battery, namely a smart charger that switches
to a very low current when it detects that the battery is full. See <a
href="charger2.html"> here</a> for more info on smart chargers.</p>

<p> An alternative, if you really don't want to invest in a smart
charger, is simply not to worry about it. The main symptom of a
battery that is suffering from voltage depression is that after using
your lights for awhile they start to go slightly dimmer and yellowish,
but then remain this way for quite some time rather than continuing to
get dimmer and dimmer. The dimmer light is due to the battery
discharging its energy at a slightly lower voltage (about 0.1V/cell)
than it should.  If you continue to use your battery through this
slightly-dimmer phase, the problem goes away, as the less desirable
crystals give up their energy. When the battery is recharged, the
better crystals are re-formed. If you do this, please keep in mind
that when the light starts to get dimmer and dimmer as the battery
capacity reaches its end, you must turn off your lights. If you
discharge the battery to lower than about 1 V/cell, you run the risk
of damaging the battery through cell reversal. </p>

<p> The fact that doing a deep discharge (down to about 1 V/cell) of
your battery cures the problem with voltage depression is probably
what lead to the myth that you should always discharge the battery
before recharging it. However, somehow the concept of "deep discharge"
has gotten mixed up with "full discharge" (down to 0V/cell), which is
quite likely to damage your battery. In this case, the cure (a full
discharge which can result in cell reversal) is far warse than the
disease (voltage depression, which only gives you slightly dimmer
lights the first time you use the battery after it developes the
problem). </p>

<p> This may be not what you are used to hearing about NiCad memory.
The problem is that misinformation (the idea that NiCad "memory" is a
loss of capacity caused by recharging after only a partial discharge)
is so prevalent that many bike light manufacturers believe in it and
propagate it. However, NiteRider at least some has some pretty good
info about <a
href="http://www.niterider.com/techinfo/geninfo_battery2.html">
battery care</a>. (Even here there is conflicting information. They
suggest that "To prevent OVERCHARGING: Do NOT charge your battery
until it has been fully drained (or charge it only enough to replenish
it)" although they make it clear just below that you should not drain
the battery beyond the point where the light turns yellow/dim. I
presume they're hoping that the customer will figure out that "fully
drained" means "until the light turns yellow/dim".)

<a name="bat-shape"><h4>Battery shape</h4></a>

<blockquote>
<p> Batteries basically come in two shapes: more or less rectangular ones
in padded nylon bags that you strap to your frame, and in water
bottles. By and large, only NiCads come in water bottle shapes, while
both NiCads and lead-acids come in rectangles.</p>

<p> With my VistaLite 430 I got a rectangular lead-acid battery. I
struggled to find a place to hang it. I couldn't attach it to my top
tube because it had three unexposed cables going along the top of it,
separated from the frame with little rubber donuts. I couldn't put the
straps on top of the cable, and it wouldn't fit between the cables and
the frame. I tried mounting the battery under the seat, and at the
intersection of the seat tube and top tube (where the cables were in
housing) but finally gave up. </p>

<p> I unhooked the cables, threw away the little rubber donuts, and
put the cables through thin (about 4mm diameter) plastic tubes,
available from the local bike shop. This protected the frame much
better, since the rubber donuts always collected themselves at one end
of the cables and let the cables scratch the frame anyway. It also
allowed me to put the straps on top of the cables. So I did. There's
an additional stabilizing strap that goes around your down tube to
stop the battery swinging around. I did that up and after a few weeks
of riding noticed that the paint was being rubbed off my frame where
the corner of the bag met the downtube. Arrrgggg... </p>

<p> So I Hammerited the bare spot and put a piece of electrical tape
over it. Then I noticed that a hole had been worn in my bag at that
place.  I dismantled an old bike glove and sewed a piece of the palm
(padded leather) to the bag at the corner. That worked, but it was
still a bit of a pain to take on and off with all those velcro
attachments.</p>

<p> Then I got a water bottle NiCad battery, and my worries were
over. The moral of this story is that water bottle-shaped batteries
are a much better approach. </p>
