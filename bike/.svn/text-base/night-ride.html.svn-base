<title>My First Night MTB Ride</title>
<h2>My First Night MTB Ride</h2>

<c>19 December 1997</c><p>

For awhile I've been inspired by what others have written (especially
<a href="http://www.charm.net/~rokslyde/nightride.html">Dave
McSpaden</a>) to try night-time MTBing. I got my first powerful set of
lights, a <a href="http://vistalite.web.aol.com/vis2a3.htm">
VistaLite 430</a> ($100 at REI), on a recent trip to the US. The
430 consists of two lighting heads that are focusable and have 10W
bulbs, and a big old heavy lead-acid battery that you have to Velcro
to the bike somehow.<p>

I attached both lighting heads to the handlebars of my MTB, one either
side of the stem, and hung the battery from the saddle. I couldn't
hang it from the top tube since I have three unprotected cables
running along the tube.  The battery plus my mudguard then took up all
of my seatpost, so I couldn't put a taillight on it. After some
thought, I got out my spare
<a href="http://vistalite.web.aol.com/vis1d.htm">VL700</a> (small but
very bright LED light) mount and put it on the seatstay. I charged up
the battery (more on that later) and I was ready to roll.<p>

The Cambridge branch of the 
<a href="http://www.ctc.org.uk/ctc.html">CTC</a> (Cyclists Touring
Club, biggest cycle club in Britain) has a mountain bike section that
meets at 7:20 every Tuesday and Thursday. A friend of mine had gone on
a couple of their rides and reported that they're good -- they go at a
nice pace along good trails (well, the best in the area, which
isn't saying a lot, it being so flat an agricultural around here). I
emailed one of the regulars to ask him about their rain/snow
cancellation policy and was told they ride in all weather. So I
figured I'd give it a try the day after I attached my lights.<p>

It rained all day, a steady tho' not heavy rain. I debated giving it a
miss, but I really needed to ride, not having done any biking (other
than commuting) in about two weeks due to being in the States.
Finally, it stopped raining about an hour before the ride. I showed up
at 7:20, and no one was there. I waited.  No one showed. At 7:30 I
decided that I'd head home and go for a short run along the path by
the river so I woldn't have a wasted evening. I was just about to hop
on the bike when a guy showed up, obviously ready for night riding. He
introduced himself as Mike. He'd heard I might be there from the
fellow I'd mailed. He asked if I'd done much off-roading. I said yup,
but not yet in the dark.<p>

So we turned on our lights and headed off. I only used one of my
lighting heads; 10W seemed to be plenty enough light. I easily kept
up with him on the road, but had to work a bit to stay with him as we
plowed through extremely wet grassy paths. The best part of the ride
was going through a patch of woods (which I've known about but never
done because there are signs on the path leading to the woods saying
no bikes). This had lots of twists and turns, tree roots and stumps,
the occasional dip, and low branches to duck under. There wasn't any
standing water in this part, and therefore no goo, and the riding
was good. I was having a great time dodging amongst the trees, and
thought how cool it would be to go through there in summer when it was
dry and light, and you could go lots faster. But it was damp, and this
was my first night ride, so I was content to go at the moderate pace
set by Mike.<p>

I found that the focussed beam I had been riding with until now was
not good enough -- I couldn't see what was coming around the curves.
So I unfocused it a bit, making it wider. I lost in ability to see far
away, but could see much better closer and and off to the sides. It
was just right for picking out tree roots. Mike had narrow beam
spotlights mounted on his bike, but had additional lights on his
helmet, which he used to great advantage in this section.<p>

Coming out of the woods, I refocused the light, as we went on more or
less straight tracks the rest of the way to the pub, where we met
another guy and had a beer. I think Mike was impressed by me. He said to
the other guy "Yeah, we did the full route, even the hard bits!". They
usually don't get many new riders in the winter, and I was a new rider
who was actually pretty good both in skills and fitness.  Furthermore,
I'm a woman, and (as he said), most women aren't into MTBing, and if
they are they often prefer to do it when it's warm and dry, and
certainly not at night. So I'm a rarity in their experience.<p>

It turns out that Mike lives near me, so we rode most of the way back
together. I had a really good ride, and I definitely plan on coming
out with them again.<p>

Info for electronics fans: the battery is a 5 Amp-hour lead-acid
battery, which will run one light (10W) for 3 hours, or both (20W) for
1.5 hours. It's basically a couple of power cords attached to a 3-cell
Cyclon monobloc make by Hawker Energy. The lighting set comes with a
stupid charger that charges the battery in 12 hours. If you don't
unplug it after 12 hours, the instructions say you can damage the
battery. But if you don't fully discharge it, you have to cut back the
amount of recharge time proportionally. I can't be bothered with
that. Luckily, my boyfriend Simon is an electronics whiz and some
number of years ago had built a smart charger for lead acid
batteries. Actually, it's not all that complicated, 
<a href="charger.html">here's</a> how to build it. It has a chip in
it called an L200 which provides constant voltage, with a limit on the
current.  In order to prevent the current from exceeding the limit, it
will lower the voltage as necessary to keep it in bounds.<p>

We modifed this charger to work with my battery. Mainly, this involved
installing a socket that matches the power plug on my VistaLite
battery. Using a ruler we found that the plug is a standard power
jack, 5.5mm external diamger, 2.5mm internal diameter, and we found
the appropriate socket at Radio Shack (Tandy). Also, since the
<a href="http://www.hepi.com/products/cyclon/cyccharg.htm">charging info
</a> on the batteries says that you don't really need to limit the
current if you're charging it at the right (floating) voltage (about
2.3 V/cell), we figured that we'd raise the current limit on the
circuit by replacing the appropriate resistors. We set it to about
1 amp.<p>

And then we plugged in the battery, which had been shipped with some
charge in it, but we didn't know how much. We monitored the voltage
and current as it charged.  First the voltage was lower than the 6.9 V
we set it for, as the current was being limited. Gradually the voltage
increased as the battery filled up some. Eventually it reached 6.9 V,
then gradually the current dropped. We left it plugged in overnight.
In the morning we found it all charged up, with the red LED that
Simon had installed (meaning, charging has stopped)
glowing. Success!<p>
