<h1> Bicycle Geometry </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This is just the beginnings of this article, which will discuss
how various aspect of bicycle geometry affect the ride of the bike. I
will gradually be adding to it from time to time. </p>

<h2> Wheelbase (WB in diagram)</h2>

<h4> Wheelbase and perceived bumps </h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The longer the wheelbase of your bike, the less you will feel
bumps. Your weight is mainly on your bottom. Since your bottom is
closer to the rear wheel, it is mainly the rear wheel bumps that you
feel. Think of it this way. If the front wheel goes over a 1cm bump,
then a point halfway between the front and rear wheels will rise then
fall by 1/2 cm, and a point just over the rear wheel will feel little
movement (since the bike will be rotated slightly about the rear
wheel, a location just above the rear wheel will feel a slight
movement backwards, then forwards. In general, the longer the
wheelbase, the longer the chainstays, and your bum will be 
more towards the center of the bike rather than over the rear wheel,
thus making the bumbs seem less extreme. </p>

<p> Similarly, if your hands are right above the contact patch of the tire
on the ground, you will feel front wheel bumps the most. If you can
get your hands behind (or even in front of) the contact patch, the
effect will be lessened. However given any particular frame, getting
the right riding position is far more important than where your hands
end up at with respect to the tire, so this isn't a very useful bit of
information. </p>
