<i>Myra VanInwegen, Mon, 06 Apr 1998</i>

<p> Tom Bielavitz was over here in England (Oxford specifically) for a 
couple of weeks to meet with the home office of his company
(Blackwell's Books). This past weekend he came over to Cambridge to
spend the weekend with Simon and me.</p> 

<p> He arrived by bus Saturday at about noon, and I drove Simon's car
downtown (all of 2.5 miles) to meet him. We left the car at the
computer lab and did the tourist thing, having lunch in a pub, seeing
the colleges, climbing the church tower, having tea in a tea shop.<p> 

<p> We headed back at about 5:30 and relaxed until dinner time. Simon made
us a nice curry. Then we all went to a movie downtown, <i>Kundun</i>, about
the most recent Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet (living in exile
in India). <p> 

<p> Sunday morning we had a nice breakfast of eggs & toast, then did some
bike work. I replaced a leaky rear tube, and Tom adjusted up Simon's
MTB so he (Tom) could ride it. This basically involved dropping the
saddle a bit. Unfortunately, it also involved adjusting the cantilever
brakes. Cantilevers on MTBs always seem to need adjusting, which is a
good part of the reason I switched to V-brakes earlier this year.<p> 

<p> Anyway, that done we put the bike rack on the car, loaded the bikes,
and drove to Thetford Forest. And we had a great ride. We rode around
for maybe an hour and a half, then went to the forest lodge for
lunch. As we were finishing up our food it started chucking it down. 
This is English for "raining cats and dogs". So we sat at our table
letting the food digest. When the worst of it was over we headed out
again, a bit slower to let the food settle. More single track. <p> 

<p> I'm finally beginning to feel more at home in Thetford forest. I'm not
the greatest at navigation; I don't have a good sense of direction. But
I'm getting enough used to the tracks that I ride on most frequently
that next time I'm there I will explore some new areas and see what's
there. <p> 

<p> We came back when we got tired and felt we'd had a good ride. We took
showers, then Simon (who had been playing with the computer all day,
trying to get some software working) fed us dinner (duck, squash,
garlic potatoes). Then we washed the bikes and then watched a video
(<i>Porterhouse Blue</i>, about a Cambridge college desperately trying to
resist change). Then to sleep.<p> 

<p> Tom and I got up at 5:15 this morning, while Simon slept on... I
delivered Tom to the bus station so he could get to the airport, then
I came back and crawled back into bed. <p> 

<p> As Simon and I got the bikes out of the garage this morning to go
to work, we found Tom's bike shoes on the garage floor. Oooops. We'll
brush them off and mail them back tomorrow...<p>

<p> But it was definitely a good weekend. Tom is a great houseguest. He
did all our dishes!<p>
