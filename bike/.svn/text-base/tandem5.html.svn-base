<h1>Celebrating 5 years in the UK</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> As of May 13th, 2001, it was five years ago that I first set foot in
this fine land. </p>

<p> To celebrate, Simon and I took out our tandem and went for a ride. We
rode from Cambridge to Saffron Walden and back. </p>

<p> We find that we get along with the tandem very well. He drives as he's
bigger, but I tend to work harder than he does, especially up hills.
(He says to people "This bike comes with a built in engine!")  When we
take the tandem he's willing to go for longer rides than he would if
we were on single bikes, so we get to go different places. At first,
slow-speed maneuvers were very difficult, but I've learned to keep my
weight absolutley neutral, and he's getting better at guiding it
through tight turns at barely above a walking pace. We've also gotten
over our reluctance to use the granny ring. At first we felt that we
shouldn't be using the granny gear around Cambridge as it's so flat,
but our chainrings are 32-42-52, so the granny ring is the same size
as the middle ring on a MTB. So now we do shift down to it when we get
to a big (well, for the Cambridge area) hill. </p>

<p> Anyway, I let Simon choose the route to and from Saffron Walden. He
chose the hilly, scenic route: over the big hill to Barrington,
through Fowlmere and Strethall, past Audley End, and into Saffron
Walden. </p>

<p> We'd meant to have lunch at one of our favorite pubs, the Pear
Tree in Hildersham. Unfortunately, after pulling all our money out of
our wallets and determining that we'd have enough for lunch, we left
it on the bed. "No problem", says Simon, "I'm pretty sure I've brought
a bank card with me, so we'll pick up some money from a bank in
Saffron Walden". We got into Saffron Walden, found some banks, and
discovered that Simon only had a credit card, not a cash card (I
hadn't brought along a wallet at all). He tried to get cash using the
credit card, but he'd forgotten the PIN. We didn't think that the Pear
Tree took credit cards and we didn't know of any good local pubs that
did, so we abandoned the plan of having a pub lunch. Instead, we went
to the Saffron Walden Waitrose and got a picnic lunch: sandwiches,
salad, olives, crisps, orange juice, and yogurt for dessert. We took
it to the village green and ate it there in the sunshine, then got
back on the bike and took a not-very direct route back to Cambridge
(through Ashdon, Bartlow and Linton). </p>

<p> As we were coming out of Hildersham we met another tandemming
couple. But not just any tandemming couple, it was the couple who had
loaned us their tandem for a test-ride when were were just beginning
to think of buying one. So they were riding the first tandem we'd ever
tried. We chatted a little while before heading off in our different
directions. </p>

<p> I managed to convince Simon to try taking the bike along the Roman
Road. Our bike is a rigid mountain bike tandem, with wide riser bars,
but kitted out for all-purpose road riding with 1.75" slick tires,
full mudguards, and a rear rack. The Roman Road is a very undemanding
off-road bit. In places it's very wide and smooth, but in places it's
a narrow smooth track (less than a foot wide) in the grass. It's the
sort of thing that I ride along almost as fast as I can, enjoying the
challenge of keeping the bike on track. Simon, however, doesn't like
off-road riding much, but I convinced him to give it a try to see how
the bike would work off-road. So we went along. The first bit was the
narrow part, and Simon was taking it very slowly (asking the engine to
ease off), really concentrating on keeping the bike on the narrow
track. I kept my weight as neutral as possible, so he could guide the
bike as he needed to. </p>

<p> Later the path widened out, and he felt confident enough to open up
the throttle a bit ("OK, you can pedal harder now"), and this part was
really fun. One of the most amusing parts of the ride were the
branches low overhead. Simon would shout "duck!" and I'd shove my head
against his back, and some leaves would brush my helmet. It's fun
not seeing what's coming at you! </p>

<p> Finally the Roman Road was over and we were back on tarmac. We
proceeded mostly uneventfully back home. We went 48 miles in total. </p>
