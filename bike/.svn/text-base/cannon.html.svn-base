<p><i> This is a modified version of a test of women's road
bikes I wrote for Cycling Plus in August '99. All the bikes I tested
(Cannondale R600 Compact Triple, Vision Pocket Rocket, Battaglin
Bambino) were based on 650c (ISO 571mm) wheels.  Since this was meant
to be a test of bikes for women, and because not all the bikes fit me,
I invited as many roadie women as I could find to ride the bikes and
give me their opinions. </i> </p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The Cannondale R600 Compact Triple has 650c wheels, fat bright red
aluminium tubes and a Shimano 105 groupset, with a triple
chainset. The wheels are semi-deep section Mavic CXP 21 rims on CODA
(Cannondale's own brand) hubs. </p>

<h4>Frame</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/gear-hanger.jpg" alt="replaceable derailleur hanger"
 ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" width=162 height=254 hspace="5">

<p> The Cannondale stands out in a crowd, its aluminium fork and fat
tubes painted in Saeco/Cannondale red and yellow. The 49cm frame size
fits me perfectly. It worked well for all of the riders of roughly my
height, suggesting that Cannondale have got the geometry right with
this one. The two water bottle braze-ons allow the use of two large
water bottles, a real plus. There are tapped holes in the rear
dropouts, but they are of little use as there is insufficient
clearance for attaching mudguards. I had about 1cm of toe overlap with
the supplied 165mm chainset. This wasn't a problem on the rides I did
with it, but there is a chance it could catch me out if I'm not
careful. The derailleur hanger is replaceable in the event of crash
damage (shown to the right). The frame and fork together weigh in at a
reasonable 4.3 lbs, the same as the Vision.</p>

<p> It's difficult to know where to put a pump. If you put it under
the top tube you can only use a small water bottle in the bottle cage
on the seat tube, and of course if you put the pump along the seat
tube you lose the second bottle entirely. A pump peg along the
seatstay would have been great, but this seems to be a luxury only
available on custom bikes. So you have a choice of riding with less
water, or using a wimpy mini-pump. </p>

<p> The frame is very stiff. The bottom bracket is rock solid when you
stand up to accelerate. This is a fine sprinter's bike. Since it's in
the Saeco/Cannondale team colors, you can add some entertainment to
your workouts by pretending you're Mario sprinting to a stage victory
in the Tour de France. </p>

<h4>Handling</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>
I like a bike that goes where I want with little effort. I felt
instantly at home on the Cannondale. It holds a straight line
remarkably well, but will corners easily, neither diving into it nor
showing and relectance to turn. In other words, it did exactly what I
wanted to, without any thought required. The handling inspired
confidence. The Vision tested at the same time required a bit more
effort to control, but I adjusted to it. </p>

<p>Of course, not everyone likes the same thing, and some riders liked
the quicker, less stable handling of the Vision and Battaglin.  They
felt that they would be happy riding the more frisky bikes in short
road races or training rides, while they would prefer the Cannondale
or Trek for longer rides, especially centuries.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Wheels</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The parts of the Cannondale wheels are well chosen. They have
semi-aero Mavic CXP 21 rims in sensible silver, CODA 700 hubs, and
black 1.8mm spokes, 28 in front and 32 in back. The thinner spokes are
suitable for a race bike, but they would be even better if they
were double butted. Cannondale have stuck with a reliable three-cross
spoking pattern rather than going for something trendy (but more
likely to damage hub flanges) like radial spoking. </p>

<p> Spoke tension isn't particularly high in the Cannondale wheels,
nor it is even. Some time spent with a spoke wrench would reward you
with more reliable wheels: the back wheel on the Cannondale has
already gone out of true by a few millimeters.</p>

<p> All the official test bikes came with 20mm tires. As an experiment
I put 23mm Continental Grand Prix 3000 tires (shown in the photo) on
the Cannondale. The resulting improvement in the ride was obvious and
welcome. The wider tires also come with a bonus of less rolling
resistance, so you don't have to sacrifice efficiency for
comfort. </p>

<p> The combination of the Cannondale's wheels with the Grand Prix
tires gave a slightly smoother ride than the Vision's aero wheels with
Fortezzas, probably due to the rigidity of the aero rims and the
suppleness of the Grand Prix tires. </p>

<h4>Equipment</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/cable-adjust.jpg" alt="cable adjuster"
 ALIGN="left" BORDER="0" width=258 height=210 hspace="5">

<p> The Cannondale has a complete Shimano 105 groupset, with a triple
chainset. The shifting and braking work perfectly, although it is
somewhat annoying that the front shifter only has three positions (one
for each of the chainrings) so you can't trim the derailleur. There is
a very nice cable adjuster on the down tube for the rear shifter cable
(shown in the picture). The 165mm cranks suited the size of the bike
perfectly. However the same cranks are used on entire line of Compact
Cannondales, and 165mm is far too long for the smaller models. I found
the range of gears ideal for club riding. Although I didn't use the
granny gear around Cambridge, it would be indispensable
elsewhere. </p>

<p> The Cannondale has a threaded headset with a sensible-length 90mm
CODA (Cannondale) stem. The front-loading stem looks more bulky than
the traditional slide-though stem, but makes it quick and easy to swap
stems to try out different positions.  The handlebars on the
Cannondale (42cm) were wider than the handlebars on the other bikes
(38cm). I appreciated this width (perhaps because I do a lot of
off-road riding) but most of the the other riders preferred the
narrower bars. </p>

<p> The saddle clamp on the Cannondale seatpost doesn't work well. I'd
crank down the bolt as hard as I could, and yet along a rough road I'd
hear a ping, and the nose of the saddle would be pointing in the
air. </p>

<p> All the test riders found that the shifting and braking from the
tops of the brake hoods was no problem with the Shimano shifters (nor
with Campag either for that matter), but braking from the drops was
difficult with both setups. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Comfort</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Comfort is mainly determined by three things: the saddle, position
on the bike, and how well the bike absorbs road shock.</p>

<p> I found I got along very well with the saddle, a CODA 900R with
Manganese rails. Despite the fact that it looks relatively
inexpensive and has a plastic cover, I found that the shape fit my
bottom well, providing support for my sit bones and not putting
pressure on sensitive areas. </p>

<p> Although the Cannondale fits my leg length perfectly, the position
of the handlebar with the stock stem is too low for my tastes. I
looked for a road stem with some rise but couldn't find one. I ended
up buying a 90mm front-loading mountain bike stem with a 25 degree
rise (MTB stems are measured from a right angle). Although this is
meant to work with 25.4mm diameter bars, it holds the 26mm diameter
Cinelli bars securely in place. Inserted all the way, this MTB stem
puts the handlebar about 1cm higher than the highest position
obtainable by the CODA stem, and when raised up the handlebar is at
nearly same level as the saddle.  As an experiment I left the MTB stem
on for all the testers. Everyone got along with the range of handlebar
heights it offered, though a few preferred the stock stem. This is an
indication of how good the position on the Cannondale is: with a
simple stem change it accommodates everyone from all-out racers
(several of the riders) to a tourist with bad elbows (me).
</p>

<p> The bike doesn't absorb shock all that well, due to the very stiff
frame, shortish wheelbase, and skinny high-pressure 20mm tires.
Still, the ride is perfectly acceptable on well-paved roads,
especially if you stand up to absorb the occasional bump, and 23mm
tires makes it even better.  Probably a carbon fiber fork, like those
on the Vision, would smooth out the ride further. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<blockquote>


<p> The Cannondale is an excellent starting point for a women's
specific bike. The handling is suberb, doing exactly what I wanted it
to, and the transmission and braking work well. I found the comfort
acceptable out of the box, and it is improved by a stem with some rise
and wider tires, neither of which cost all that much. The smaller
models, however, will need a chainset transplant to obtain
sufficiently short cranks, and this can cost quite a bit. </p>

<p> I was so pleased with both the looks and performance of this bike
that I bought it, despite the fact that I rarely race. I would have
liked it even more if I could somehow squeeze in some mudguards, but
as it is it's a fabulous bike for fast road rides on good days. </p>

<p>... And then a bit over a year later I sold it. I simply don't
trust English weather: it can be fine and sunny in the morning and be
raining a few hours later. If I'd found some way of fitting decent
mudguards to the bike I'd have kept it: it really is a good bike, a
joy to ride. With the proceeds of the sale of the bike I'll get a
custom-made Audax frame that will (hopefully) handle as well as the
Cannondale, but will have mudguard clearance. </p>
