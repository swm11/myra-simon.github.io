<p> All the information in this article comes from Chapter 5 "Optimum
Pedaling Cadence," by J. Coast, in <i>High-Tech Cycling</i> (Edmund
Burke, editor, Human Kinetics, 1996). This chapter summarizes various
experiments done to determine the opimal cadence for cycling. They
found that optimum cadence varied, depending both on how much power
you are producing, and what you hope to maximize in your assessment
of "optimal." </p>

<p> First, let's assume that "optimal" means "most efficient
aerobically," i.e. least amount of oxygen consumed. They found that,
generally, the more power you're putting out, the higher your cadence
should be. The numbers run something like this: optimum cadence when
you're dawdling along (producing 50W power output) is about 40 rpm,
while optimum cadence for a real effort (300W output) is about 80
rpm. </p>

<p> Now let's say that "optimal" means "least stress on joint
and muscles," i.e. your biggest problem is not aerobic capacity but
how tired your muscles are getting and how much stress is being put on
your knees and other joints. This is more a concern for endurance
athletes, like in longer road races and Tour De France stages. When
examined for this, the best cadence was in the order of 95 to 100 rpm
(I think they were only considering high power outputs in these
experiments). </p>

<p> Also, the lower gear provided by a high cadence means that
acceleration is easy, so higher cadence is important in road races
(when you have to be ready at all times to follow a break). Acceleration
is largely irrelevant in time trials. </p>

<p> So this is why you see relatively low cadences in town cyclists
(they're not putting out much energy), high cadences in road racers,
and medium cadences in time trialers. </p>
