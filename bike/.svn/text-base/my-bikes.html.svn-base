<p> After quite a collection of 1-speeds when I was a kid, I bought my
first quality bike, a Schwinn Le Tour, with paper route money when I
was 16.  Unfortunately I didn't buy a good lock with it, and I left it
outside in the back yard, so it got stolen within a month. About a
year later, when I could afford to replace the bike, I bought another
Schwinn Le Tour, and I bought a Kryptonite lock and kept it in the
basement at night.</p>

<p> I kept that until 1988, when I bought my touring bike, a Panasonic
PT3500, which I still have. In early 1996, I bought a mountain bike, a
Trek 950, and in the summer of 1997 I bought a medium quality used
racing bike made by Paul Milnes. In summer 1998 I added a vintage MTB,
a 1989 Fisher AL-1, one of the first aluminum bikes that Fisher
made. My most recent addition is my oldest bike, a '67 or '68 three
speed made by Edwards of Camberwell. </p>

<p> I really enjoy the different characteristics of my bikes. I like to
play with them, to adjust them, to wash them after rides, to replace
parts in an aim to make them just right for me. But above all, I love
to ride. Nothing compares to the feeling of freedom I get with the
road or trail rolling away under my wheels, the joy of balance, the
sunshine, the ever-present wind... Do I sound like an addict? I am.</p>

<p> I have made many modifications to my bikes. The touring bike
(left) has had most of its parts replaced over the years for one
reason or another. Currently only the frame, seatpost, and derailleurs
are original. Except that the derailleurs have just been removed as
I've converted it to a fixed gear! </p>

<p> The racer was second hand and came with a weird assortment of
parts, some new and great, some old and lousy, some new and not really
all that useful. I had alot of fun fixing it (replacing parts) to get
it in good working order. Its most recent alteration was getting the
drop bars replaced by narrow mountain bike bars. I have chronic
tendonitis in my elbows, and if I put my hands on the part of the
handlebars where it starts to curve forward it irritates them. A
straight bar plus bar ends gives me a similar range of positions
(minus the drops and the curved part that irritates my elbows). </p>

<p> The mountain bike (Trek 950, right) has also undergone a great deal of
change, although these have been upgrades rather than significant
changes in character.  The rigid fork got replaced by a suspension
fork, the cantis got replaced by V-brakes, and lots of purple anodized
parts appear scattered over the bike. It looks pretty slick, which I'm
slightly embarassed about. </p>

<a href="fisher.html">

<p> The Fisher (left) is slightly too small for me. The seat tube is plenty
long enough to get the height right, but the top tube is too short, so
I end up with a very upright riding position. Given my elbow problems,
this is a good thing, and I'm using it for road riding when I don't
want to go too fast (it's bit undergeared and heavy). Since I like it
as a vintage MTB, I haven't done too much to it. At least, I haven't
changed any of the drivetrain... I have put slick tires, clipless
pedals, and mudguards on it, and I've built it a new front wheel with
a hub dynamo. </p>

<p> Since I just got the 3-speed I haven't done anything with it yet,
other than adjusting it up right (getting the shifting working,
tightening up the brakes, aligning the dynamo with the tire better).
However, something certainly has to be done about the dynamos. Yes
plural!  It has two of them: a Sturmey-Archer Dynohub in the front
wheel unused (although it works, I checked), and a bottle dynamo on
the seatstay which powers the lights. This is silly. I will either
rebuild the front wheel and move the Dynohub to another bike, or
remove the draggy bottle dynamo and hook up the Dynohub to provide
lighting. </p>

<p> I have done much with my bikes. Most of what I have done has been
with my touring bike, since I've had it the longest. I've tried road
racing, touring, distance riding (culminating in a double century),
mountain biking, and cyclocross. My main interest now is in what I
call off-road touring, which is basically just riding a mountain bike
over whatever terrain I find, going a reasonable distance (a typical
ride would be 20-30 miles) at a moderate pace. But I still like
on-road touring and training, since it's an easy way to pack in the
miles. It's especially appealing after it's been raining awhile and
the trails are a mess. </p>
