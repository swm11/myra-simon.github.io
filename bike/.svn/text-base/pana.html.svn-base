<p>My touring bike, a Panasonic PT3500. This picture was taken while I
was touring <a ahref="oregon.html">Oregon</a> in 1990. My method of
carrying luggage had improved drastically since the last tour. The
weight was now very low, due to lowrider front panniers. There was
nothing on the top of the rack other than a plastic dinosaur (a
Cetiosaurus from the British Museum of Natural History, unforunately
not visible in the photo). The handling was much improved.</p>
