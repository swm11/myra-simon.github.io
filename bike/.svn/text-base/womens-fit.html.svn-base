<h1> Buying a bike that fits a woman </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This article covers what you need to know to buy (or even design)
a bike frame that can be adapted to meet the needs of a woman. It
covers all kinds of bikes, but mostly concentrates on MTBs, racing
bikes, and touring bikes. See <a href="what_women.html">What to look
for in a women's bike</a> for comments on how to adapt this frame so
it's perfect for you. </p>

</blockquote>

<h2>The Source of the Problem</h2>

<blockquote>

</p> There are quite a few challenges associated with selecting a bike
for small people (usually women, since women are generally smaller
than men). They boil down to the fact the the bike needs to have a top
tube that is low enough (allowing you to stand over the bike easily)
and has the bars within easy reach (high enough and close enough that
you don't have to stretch for them). </p>

<p> Women seems to have a worse time than men with getting the bars in
easy reach. Many people explain this desire for a shorter reach to the
handlebars than is offered by standard bikes by saying that women
typically have longer legs and shorter torsos than men of the same
height. However, this simply isn't true: statistical studies of
dimensions of men and women show that proportionally, men and women
have the same length of legs. However, women do have proportionally
shorter arms than men, as well as smaller hands. In addition, there is
a possibility that women's backs bend differently than men's backs,
but I haven't seen any hard evidence to back this up. </p>

<p> For the purposes of this article, I'll put bikes in three
categories: mountain bikes are bikes with 26" wheels and more or less
straight handlebars, hybrids are bikes with 700c wheels (which are
larger than MTB wheels) and more or less straight handlebars, and road
bikes include all bikes that have drop bars and (usually) 700c
wheels. Note that I'm putting racing style bikes along with the
traditional touring bike in the last category. (See <a
href="whatbike.html">What kind of bike do you need?</a> if you're not
sure what I'm talking about here.) </p>

<p> Even if we assume that women are proportionally exactly the same
as men are, we would find that women would still feel more stretched
out than men on a bike that is appropriate for their leg length. The
reason for this is simply their size, combined with the way that bikes
are designed. Let's look at bike geometries. For examples, I will
select bikes from the 2001 Trek catalog. Trek are very good in making
their bikes in a wide range of sizes, and offering some women's
specific (WSD) bikes. I'll use the Trek 4000 series bikes as examples
of generic (not women's specific) MTBs, the 2000 series and as
examples of generic road bikes, and the 7000-series bikes as examples
of generic hybrid bikes. </p>

<p> The average man is about 5'10", while the average woman is about
5'4". Bike sizes are generally arranged so that the size of bike that
fits the medium sized man falls in the middle of the sizes of
bikes. Trek expect that medium sized men will ride the 18" or 19.5"
MTBs, while they will ride the 56cm or 58cm road bikes and the 20"
hybrid. In the world of road bikes, medium-sized women can (maybe) fit
the smallest bike size, while in the world of MTBs, a medium sized
woman fits perhaps the next-to-smallest size of bike,and for hybrids,
a medium-sized woman would go for a 15" or 17.5" hybrid. A small woman
can't fit a standard road bike at all, while a small woman might be
able to fit the smallest size MTB or hybrid. </p>

<p> For all types of bikes, note that frame sizes larger than
those "medium" sizes have proportionally shorter top tubes (as shown
by the last row, the length of top tube divided by frame size, which
is the length of the seat tube), while the smaller frames have
proportianlly longer top tubes. Thus the smaller frames, the ones that
the women will be riding, if they can ride the bikes at all, have
proportionally longer top tubes than medium and large frames. </p>

<p> This is the major cause of problems when women go to find bikes
that fit them. Add in the fact that women in general have shorter arms
than men, and it's no surprise that women often find themselves too
stretched out on bikes. </p>

<p> Please note that I am not picking on Trek! This non-proportionality
of top tube lengths is true for all brands of bikes. </p>

<p> Also, please note that in the rest of this article I assume that
you are looking for a fit similar to what medium-sized men get when
they ride their road or mountain bikes. If you are a woman with a long
torso for her height, or you like being stretched out, then feel free
to ignore all the below advice and simply buy a stock generic
bike. </p>

<h2>Finding a bike that fits: MTB</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> The first thing to note is that although pretty much all bike
styles have this non-proprtionality of top tube lengths, some bike
styles have longer top tubes than others. Actually, amongst
MTBs, the Trek 4000-series have fairly short top tubes, while Scotts
(and Trek 8000-series bikes) have longer top tubes. So one thing to do
is to get a type of bike that comes with a shorter top tube. </p>

<p> Another thing you can do is replace the stem that
comes with the bike with one that has a higher rise and shorter
reach. Check out <a href="bodge.html">Bodge Your Bike to Fit</a> for
advice on stems and handlebars that will give you a comfy riding
position. </p>

<b>Warning!</b> different manufacturers have different ways of
measuring top tubes. All modern MTBs have sloping top tubes. What you
really want to know is, what's the distance from the saddle to the
head tube (you can replace the stem so you're not really all that
worried about the distance from the head tube to the handlebars). If
you measure the actual length of the top tube, this doesn't give you
the information you need. What you need to know is "effective top tube
length", which is the distance from the intersection of the top tube
and head tube, horizontally to where that horizontal line intersects
with the seat post (it's the FL measurement in the chart <a
href="pt-specs.html#geometry">here</a>). Some geomtry charts don't
make it clear which top tube measurement they are giving. Trek always
uses effective top tube, while for example, Scott at least used to use
actual top tube lengths. For any bike with a sloping top tube, the
actual TT measurement will be shorter than the effective top tube, so
if a chart gives the actual TT measurement, it will look like it has a
shorter top tube! If you're uncertain as to what the geometry charts
say, take your tape measure along to measure the top tube
yourself. </p>

<p> One problem with modern MTBs is that almost all of them come with
threadless headsets. If the steerer tubes have been left long, so that
quite a bit of steerer is showing above the top of the head tube, then
you'll have some height adjustment by rearranging spacers.
Unfortunately, many manufacturers cut the steerer tubes of the bikes
quite short, so that there's just enough space left for the stem. On
the latter bikes, there's not much your local shop can do to raise the
bars for you, short of replacing the stem. It's worth asking your
local shop which manufacturers leave the steerers long, and buying
those bikes. When the shop assembles the bike for you, ask them to put
lots of spacers under the stem before they cut the steerer. That way
you can rearrange the spacers to change the height of your bars, and
when you're happy with the position, if you find that you have a few
spacers on top of the stem, you can take the bike back to the shop to
get them to cut it to just the right length. </p>

<p> For comparison, I am 5'5", about medium sized for a woman. I fit
quite comfortably on a 16.5" Trek bike, with the following
modifications. I've replaced the fork, and I've left space for about
3cm worth of spacers beneath the stem. Furthmore, I use a stem which
is about 9cm long (shorter than the supplied one), and has about a 20
degree rise (the supplied stem had very little rise). I can ride this
bike all day with no problems. </p>

<p> Another route to take is to buy a women's specific bike. For
example, the Trek WSD MTBs have the following specs: </p>

<p>
<table align=center border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr><th colspan=4>Trek WSD MTB</th></tr>
<tr><th>frame size</th><td>14"</td><td>16"  </td><td>18"</td></tr>

<tr><th>top tube</th> <td>20.4"</td><td>21"  </td><td>22.2"</td> </tr>

<tr><th>TT/frame size</th> <td>1.46</td><td> 1.31 </td><td> 1.23 </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p> You can see that they still follow the same pattern of smaller
bikes having proportionally longer top tubes, but at least the top
tubes are shorter than you'd find on the 4000-series bikes of similar
size. In addition, Trek WSD bikes have other features useful for
women, such as softer suspension settings. </p>

<p> How will you know which bike suits you? Try them out! Find a
cooperative shop, and get them to let you try out the bikes. Probably
they won't let you try them out off-road, but at least going for a
short ride around town should give you some idea of whether the bike
suits you. A good shop will change them stem for your test ride, too,
so don't judge the bike just on the equipment it comes with. </p>

<h2>Finding a bike that fits: road</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> Remember that under the category of "road" bikes, I'm including
both the racing style built-for-speed bikes, and touring bikes. </p>

<p> Women have a much harder time finding a road bike that fits than a
MTB that fits. I'll use myself as an example. I'm 5'5", about average
for a woman. The length of my legs is such that I get along well with
a 50cm seat tube. However, the 50cm Trek 2000-series bike has a top
tube of 52.3cm. The medium-sized bikes have top tubes that are the
same size or slightly shorter than the seat tubes. Therefore, I feel
completely justified in asking for a top tube that's 50cm or less.
You might wonder if I really need this short a top tube. You might
think that I could get a good fit from the 50cm Trek bike by simply
putting on a short stem. However, this doesn't really work. I tried it
on one of the racing-style bikes that I had. The problem is that when
you put an extra-short stem on drop bars, you get a bike that's hard
to control.  What happens is that there ends up being a very short
distance between where you put your hands, and the steering axis of
the bike. This means that if you make a small movement of your hands,
this translates into a relatively large anglular movement of the
steering. The bike simply responds too much to your steering
input. Thus you really do need a shorter top tube. (Using a short stem
works with MTB bars, as long as they're wider ones. For example I can
use a 50mm stem on a 24" bar with bar ends with no problem.) </p>

<p> Some manufacturers do make bikes with shorter top tubes. For example,
Specialized makes a racing-style bike with a top tube that's just
under 50cm. This sounds good, but there is a serious problem with this
bike: the toe of my shoe would hit the wheel as I turned the front
wheel. This is called toe overlap, and it can cause a crash. It is to
be avoided if at all possible. </p>

<p> Bringing in the front wheel so close that it hits the foot is one
way in which manufacturers can make the top tube shorter. Another way
is to make the seat tube angle steeper. Some manufacturers try to make
a positive point of this, saying that it helps put a woman's hips
above the pedals. Er, if this is such a good thing, why isn't it done
on men's bikes? For more insight into this, see Peter Jon White's <a
href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fitting.htm">discussion of bike
fit</a>, especially the section "The Fore-Aft Saddle position". Since
saddle fore-aft position is in part determined by body weight
distribution, and a woman's weight is further down than a man's (more
in the hips and less in the shoulders) it does make sense to have the
saddle slightly further forward on a woman's bike than on a man's
bike. However, I find that I'm far more comfortable with my saddle
reasonably far back. For awhile I owned a Cannondale racing bike with
a seat tube of 74.5 degrees, and I was only comfortable using a saddle
with fairly long rails, and pushing the saddle as far back as it would
go. <a
href="http://draco.acs.uci.edu/rbfaq/FAQ/44.html"> Pamela Blalock</a>,
a very experienced long-distance rider, shares my dislike of saddles
that are too forward. Chris Juden, technical director of the CTC, also
suggests that women tend to sit further back on the saddle than
men. So I'm not convinced by the argument that steep seat angles are
useful for women. </p>

<p> The problem with finding a top tube that's short enough is even
worse with touring bikes, which usually take bigger tires than racing
bikes, and which should have enough toe clearance to allow you to fit
a mudguard (aka fender in US-speak). </p>

<p> Below I discuss ways to design bikes for women, especially small
to medium women. </p>

<IMG SRC="images/fixed2.jpg" alt="old touring bike" align="left"
     ALIGN="center" width=251 height=248 hspace="5">

<p> For smaller women, there is even the problem that their legs can't
straddle the top tube of a bike designed around 700c wheels. Even
though I'm medium-sized I have a related problem with my old touring
bike (picture left). I can barely stand over this bike: even with
fairly skinny tires the top tube hits my crotch. It certainly is
possible to make a 700c bike that I can stand over easily. What's
going on here?  It took me many years to realize this, but the problem
is the height of the bottom bracket: with 28mm tires it's 31cm off the
ground! A more usual BB height is 26.5 to 28cm for racing and touring
bikes. What has happened here is that in designing a bike with a small
frame (49cm seat tube c-t), instead of finding a way to bring the top
down, they've instead brought the bottom bracket up. </p>

<p> There are several disadvantages of a high bottom bracket. The main
one is that a bad design can prevent you from standing comfortably
over the frame. (In bike geometry jargon, we say that the
<i>standover</i> is too big. The standover is the distance between
floor and top of top tube at about midpoint of the top tube, shown as
the HT measurement in the chart <a href="pt-specs.html#geometry">
here</a>.) Minor disadvantages are that you can't put a foot on the
ground while sitting in the saddle, and that the center of gravity is
higher so that the bike is slightly less stable. Then on the other
hand, it is possible to have a bottom bracket too low. I use 165mm
cranks, and I find that with a 26cm high BB if I pedal around a sharp
corner I can hit the pedal on the ground. Nevertheless, I like bikes
with 26cm BBs; I don't tend to pedal around sharp corners, so pedal
strike isn't a major issue for me. For someone who uses shorter cranks
than I do, a 26cm or less BB height would be ideal. </p>

<p> The way to avoid a too-high BB is a sloping top tube. This allows
the back end of the top tube to be quite low for a low standover,
while the front end is high enough to allow for at least a
minimal-sized head tube.  When looking at small bikes, check the BB
figures. If the BB height is much over 27cm, this is a signal that the
manufacurers are trying to shorten the seat tube by raising the BB
instead of lowering the TT enough. For these bikes, pay special
attention to the standover height, and make sure you have sufficient
crotch clearance. Also see if it's possible to put your toe on the
ground when you've got the saddle at the right height. If it is
important for you to be able to do this, and the bike you're looking
at doesn't allow this, look elsewhere for a bike with a lower BB. </p>

<IMG SRC="images/compclub_sm.jpg" alt="Compact Clubman" align="right"
     ALIGN="center" width=344 height=203 hspace="5">

<p> Here is a bike that solves the problems of fitting a medium-sized
woman on a bike with 700c wheels and drop bars. It's the <a
href="comp_club.html">Roberts Compact Clubman</a> to the right. I have
loads of standover clearance on this bike. </p>

<p> This bike is a masterpiece of design. A great deal of effort has
gone into creating this. It has a low bottom bracket, a short top
tube, a seat angle that isn't too steep, plenty of top tube clearance,
and enough toe clearance for a 25mm tire plus a mudguard. It's worth
looking closely at what's been done to allow this. (See this <a
href="pt-specs.html#geometry">geometry chart</a> for info on what I'm
talking about here; the ROB row in the chart is very similar to the
bike in the picture.) </p>

<p> First, I use 165mm cranks. This fact was taken into account in
figuring out exactly how close the front wheel can be to the bottom
bracket. The bottom bracket is low at 26cm. This helps to get the top
tube lower. The top tube slopes quite a bit. This accomplishes several
things. First, it makes the standover height lower than a straight top
tube would be. Second, it allows a very long head tube. The extremely
long head tube allows the handlebars to be raised quite high (level
with the saddle) while using a standard stem. The head angle is
shallow by today's standards, about 70 degrees. This shoves the front
wheel out further from the BB. The fork rake is longer than usual to
keep the trail from being too long, and this kicks the front wheel out
even further. The seat tube angle is fine at 73 degrees (although the
Roberts in the geometry chart has a steeper seat angle at 75
degrees). The difference in the seat tube and head angles, and the
fact that the top tube joins the head tube so high up, means that the
effective top tube length is very short at 50cm. I personally don't
like the looks of this bike very much, but one has to admire the
design skill that's gone into it. And the tricks used here can be used
to design bikes that look a bit more normal. </p>

<IMG SRC="images/cannon_sm.jpg" alt="Cannondale Compact" align="left"
     ALIGN="center" width=315 height=189 hspace="5">

<p> Perhaps the most obvious way to get a lower, shorter top tube is
to use smaller wheels. Since the wheel has a smaller diameter, you can
have a decent length head tube and the top tube will still be lower
than it was with larger wheels. The top tube can be made much shorter
with smaller wheels as well, since the front axle can be brought back
much closer to the bottom bracket before the tire starts to touch your
toe. However, there is still the problem that the handlebars can be
too low. The stem shown in the picture of the <a
href="cannon.html">Cannondale</a>, left, is not the original stem. I
installed one with quite a bit of rise to bring the handlebars closer
to level of the saddle. An alternative way of getting the handlebars
higher is to have a sloping top tube, which results in a longer head
tube. </p>

<p> While this Cannondale fit me well and handled beautifully, it had
a few problems. First, it has a fairly steep head angle of 73 degrees,
which means that despite having smaller (650c, ISO 571mm) wheels, I
still get toe overlap! Also, the seat tube angle is fairly steep at
74.5 degrees. </p>

<p> If you want smaller wheels on your bike, you'll have to decide
which size. (It seems that manufacturers have settled on two main
sizes. For a discussion of the variety of wheel sizes that were used,
see Chris Juden's <a href="pt-bits.html#wheels">What size small
wheel?</a>) Some of the sizes accept a limited range of tire widths,
so if you are looking to buy a bike, your first step is to decide what
you will use the bike for. (For another slant on this, see <a
href="whatbike.html">What kind of bike do you need?</a>) From that
you decide what width of tires you will need. General guides are:</p>

<p> racing/training: 18 to 23mm* <br>
<a href="http://www.audax.uk.com">Audax</a>/fast touring: 25 to 28mm<br>
touring: 28mm and up<br></p>

<p> *Although tires narrower than 23mm are commonly used, 23mm tires are
better since they are more comfortable, have less rolling resistance,
and are more resistant to pinch flats. </p>

<p> Wheel size designations can be confusing. For example, how big is a
700c road wheel in comparison to a 26" mountain bike wheel? The best
way to describe wheel size is using the ISO size, which is the
diameter of the bead seat of the rim in mm. I will give the ISO size
for all wheels I mention.</p>

<p> Quite a few companies, including Trek and Cannondale, make road
bikes with 650c wheels (ISO 571mm). The widest tires made for these
wheels are 23mm, and even these are much harder to find than 20mm
tires. Thus these bikes are only appropriate for racing and training,
and their geometries reflect this (having steep seat and head
tubes). The top tubes on bikes with 650c wheels are generally shorter
than on road bikes with 700c wheels. The specs of the Trek WSD bikes
are: </p>

<p>
<table align=center border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>

</table>
</p>

<p> Note that the smaller of these bikes still have long top tubes for
the frame size. Nevertheless, the top tubes are shorter than the men's
bikes. I would take either the 47cm or 52cm model in order to get my
desired 50cm top tube. This would enable me to have a comfy ride,
which I couldn't get even on the smallest men's model.</p>

<p> Top tubes can be made still shorter than you find on these bikes:
the <a href="battaglin.html">Battaglin</a> that I tested for Cycing
Plus has a 45cm top tube. However that bike had very twitchy
handling. It had quite a short wheelbase; perhaps this contributed to
the unstable handling. Or it may have been a smaller amount of trail;
it's hard to know exactly. </p> 

<p> Also note that the BB height on the three smallest sizes of bike
is higher than in should be, so watch the crotch clearance if you're
thinking of buying. </p>

<p> If you want a smaller wheeled bike for Audax or touring, you would
be better off using 26" mountain bike wheels (ISO 559mm). Tires for
these wheels come in sizes falling in the Audax and touring ranges. At
the moment there aren't a huge number tires in the Audax range, but
the selection is growing all the time, and even now there are enough
tires by manufacturers such as Ritchey, Panaracer, Specialized, and
Continental, that you would be able to fine a tire that suits your
needs. In the touring ranges the selction is better. People who tour
with MTB wheels tend to use wider tires than they would using 700c
tires. It seems that 1.5" (38mm) is the norm, with a 1.25" Tioga City
Slicker or 1.3" Vredestein S-lick (which are roughly 33-36mm wide)
being about the thinnest people use. </p>

<p> Touring bikes with 26" mountain bike wheels are getting quite
popular. Orbit makes a few (the Romany and Caraway, and their

<p> Note that the range of TT/frame size ratios here appears to be the
same as with the generic (not women-specific) Trek 2000-series
bikes. However, this is misleading: the top tubes are sloping, so the
"frame size" is smaller than it would be with a horizontal top
tube. These bikes have shorter top tubes than the Treks, and
furthermore are available in smaller sizes than the Treks. The Trek
2000 that comes closest to fitting me is the 50cm one, which has a top
tube of 52.3cm. The XTC that fits me is the 47.5cm model, which has a
top tube of 50cm, my ideal length! Note also that the bottom brackets
are at a reasomable height. Not very low, but low enough to show that
Thorn haven't made the seat tube shorter simply by raising the bottom
bracket. </p>

<h4>Different sized wheels on the same bike!</h4>

<p> Often, these smaller bikes have a steep seat tube angle (74 to 76
degrees), as this makes the top tube shorter. I've noted above why I
don't think this is such a great idea. <a
href="http://www.terrybicycles.com/"> Terry</a> in the US uses smaller
front wheels on their smaller bikes to allow a short top tube with a
73 degree seat tube angle while avoiding toe overlap. </p>

<p> Terry use 26" rear wheels and 24" front wheels. However, the exact
wheel size depends on the model! The rear wheels are MTB size (ISO
559mm) for the mountain bikes and road 26" (aka 650c or ISO 571mm)
wheels on the sportier models. On the front the sportier model has an
ISO 520mm wheel. The off-road models have an ISO 507mm front
wheel. The tires that go with these are rarely stocked in shops, but
can be ordered from shops or from Terry.</p>

<p> It is hard to make a direct comparison of these bikes with the
Thorns, as Thorn don't put the seat tube angles of their bikes in
their geometry charts. However, it's probably safe to assume that the
Thorn bikes have steeper seat tube angles than 73 degrees. </p>

<p> The different sized wheels result in an odd looking bike, and
necessitates carrying two spare tubes (and spare tires if you're on a
long tour), but if you want a slacker seat tube angle, it may well be
worth it. (If you want such a bike in the UK, look to <a
href="http://www.tanatcycles.com/audax.htm">Tanat Cycles</a>, who use
the same sort of designs in their frames.) </p>

<h4>Even smaller?</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Note that the smllest top tube we've come across on any of these
bikes is 48cm. Since I take a 50cm top tube, this doesn't really fit a
person much smaller than I am! What can you do if you're smaller? </p>

<p> The first thing to consider is to abandon drop bars. Using
straight bars instead brings back the reach a great deal, as the main
grip area on flat bars is even with the stem instead of quite a ways
forward of the stem for road bikes. You can also use a shorter stem as
MTB bars are wider. You could easily put straight bars on the Thorn
XTC, or even use a simple MTB or a women's specific MTB with skinny
slick tires. </p>

<p> If you want to stick with drop bars, you'll have to either put up
with a top tube that's quite a bit longer than your seat tube, or go
custom. One custom approach is to use the tricks Roberts does, but
applied to MTB wheels. Or take the Thorn proportions, and use it on
smaller wheels than MTB wheels, say the size of wheels Terry use on
the front of their bikes. If you want a very sporty bike (with skinny
tires, say 23-25mm and no mudguards), you can use the Thorn design,
but you'll be able to bring the front wheel closer to the bottom
bracket (since the skinny tire will take up less space than a 1.5"
tire plus mudguard), allowing a top tube that's at least 2cm shorter. 
All these require the active participation of a framebuilder who knows
exactly what he's doing. </p>

<h4>Don't have $1000 or 1000 pounds to spare?</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Unfortunately these bikes are very expensive. Almost all of them
are $1000 or 1000 quid or more. The only ones that aren't are the
<a href="http://www.orbit-cycles.co.uk/mer1.htm">Orbit Mercury</a>
bikes. They are available in race (with 650c wheels) and tour (with
MTB wheels) form. The touring bike is available either with drop bars
or straight bars. These bikes are well designed with inexpensive but
correctly fitting parts, and they also come with short 160mm
cranks. Despite being built with an eye towards economy they're around
500 pounds. Much less expensive than the others, but still a fair
chunk. </p>

<p> If you can't afford that, then I'm afraid you'll either have to
put up with a top tube that's a fair bit longer than the seat tube, or
abandon drop bars and go for the MTB solution. </p>
