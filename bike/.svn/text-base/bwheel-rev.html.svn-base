<h1> Review of <i>The Bicycle Wheel</i> </h1>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p> Jobst Brandt's book <i>The Bicycle Wheel</i> is a classic. Despite
being fairly old (first published in 1981) the information remains up
to date, and it applies just as well to mountain bike wheels as to
road wheels. The writing is terse and dry, but the information is
valuable enough to make it worth a read for beginner and experienced
wheelbuilders alike. </blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p> The book has three parts. Part I discusses the various aspects of
wheelbuilding. These include choice of materials as well as different
numbers of spokes and lacing patterns. For each aspect, Brandt
discusses a number of alternatives, then states his preferred method
and gives reasons for his preference. However, he gives you the
information you need to allow you to construct wheels with any method
and materials you choose. </p>

<p> Part II is a step by step guide to building wheels.  Here he
sometimes restates the conclusions he came to in the first section and
shows how the steps give the correct result. Part III is the most
technical one. He shows his test apparatus and describes the
experiments and theoretical analysis he did to derive the results
presented earlier. </p>

<p> All through the writing is precise and direct. No attempt has been
made to try to make the book fun to read. This is a valid approach to
the subject, but in my experience the addition of the occasional story
and joke can help make technical material more digestable. It's still
perfectly readable, but it's not as enjoyable as it might have been
had a few lighthearted bits been included.

<h4>Great drawings and tech info, but could use a few more words in
places.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> One of the best features of this book is the multitude of
drawings. They help greatly in explaining the concepts. For example,
Figure 45 below shows a partially laced wheel with the third set of
spokes inserted but not yet laced. It clearly shows (in the book,
although not necessarily in the reproduction shown here) which side
of the flanges the spoke heads are on, which side of the hub is the
drive side (the side with the threads), which spokes cross which other
ones, and the offset of the spoke holes in the rim. </p>

<tr><td align="center">
<IMG SRC="images/fig45.gif" alt="drawing of partially laced wheel" 
     ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace="10">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Figure 45</i></td></tr>
</table> </center>

<p> These line drawings are far clearer than a photograph could
be. Consider a photograph of a wheel in the same state as the drawing
above. The photo would show a silver rim, silver spokes, silver
nipples, and a silver hub, and you wouldn't be able to distinguish
anything. Furthermore, you wouldn't be able to see the offset of the
spoke holes as well in the photo, since they have been exaggerated in
the drawing. </p>

<p> Another positive feature of the book is the great wealth of
technical information.  Most of the descriptions given, although
terse, explain clearly what's going on. This is true even when the
concepts are non-intuitive, such as "a wheel supports its load on the
bottom few spokes". This may seem strange, since spokes don't have any
compressive strength: if you push on the ends they just bend. But this
concept is explained with the help of lots of diagrams and analogies,
and you gradually begin to understand what he's saying. By the time
you get to the end of the section you should be convinced. </p>

<p> However, in a few places the book could use a bit more
explanation. Usually you can figure out what is meant if you stare at
it and mull over it long enough, but a few extra words here and there
wouldn't go amiss.  For an example where I think some extra
explanation could be useful, look at the graph below. </p>

<center><table border=0 align=center>
<tr><td align="center">
<IMG SRC="images/fig16.gif" alt="graph of wheel deflection" 
     ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" hspace="10">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Figure 16</i></td></tr>
</table> </center>

<p> This graph is an example of the topnotch information you'll find
in the book. Once you figure out what it says, it is an elegant and
compact way of displaying a great deal of data. It is the sort of
diagram that Edward Tufte, author of <i>The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information</i>, would be very pleased with: it is a
simple, uncluttered, easy to read (once you understand it)
presentation of relevant facts. However, like many of the better
graphs in Tufte's book, it needs some explanation, and I felt that the
explanation given in the book (below) isn't enough.

<blockquote><p> A typical six-speed rear wheel is
shown in cross section. The horizontal scale in this graph (mm)
represents the actual hub dimensions. The curves show the change in
spoke tension and the force required to displace the rim and cause
these tension changes. The left spokes become slack for even small rim
deflections to the left while the right spokes remain tight for the
range of displacements shown. This wheel is twice as stiff for
deflections to the right as to the left. The graph can be verified by
observing that, when unlacing a rear wheel, the right spokes do not
become slack if the left side spokes are removed first. </p></blockquote>

<p> It took me a fair bit of time to see how the graph works, but now
that I understand it I quite like it. Maybe I was just being thick
when I came across it: I'm not sure now why it took me so long
initially to figure it out. At any rate, an example of reading the
graph would have helped me to get it much more quickly. </p>

<h4>Relevance to mountain bike wheels.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> A quick look through the book will show you that all the drawings
show road wheels (with screw-on freewheels at that). However, almost
all the principles described work just as well for mountain bike
wheels. The only one that doesn't (the rim overloading method
described in Finding the Right Tension in Part II) is explicitly
stated as not being applicable to mountain bike wheels, and
alternative methods are given. </p>

<p> Many of the topics covered in the book are surprisingly relevant
to current trends in spoked mountain bike wheels. For example, number
and thickness of spokes, cross sections of rims, anodized and ceramic
coated rims, alumimun vs. nickle-plated brass nipples, and radial
spoking are all discussed. There are only a few topics that are not
discussed. One is asymmetric rims, in which the spoke holes in rear
rims are offset from the center line of the rim, as in Bontrager ASYM
or Ritchey OCR rims. Another is the process of machining sidewalls of
rims, such as on many Mavic rims. I would like to know what Brandt
thinks of these. </p>

<p>[After writing this review I wrote to Brandt to ask him the
questions above. He doesn't like machined sidewalls at all. He writes
"I don't know what advantage is gained by machining rims other than
expense, making the side walls variably thin and leaving little wear
margin.  I have used more rims than I'd like to think of and have
never had any problem with the smoothness or continuity of the side
walls." He also doesn't think that asymmetric rims are such a great
idea. His main complaint is that since the spoke holes are nearer to
the edge of the rim, double eyelets can't be used. However, since MTB
rims rarely have double eyelets in the first place, this doesn't seem
to me to be a good reason to avoid them.]</p>

<h4>What you will get from this book.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> There are several ways to approach this book, depending on the
level you're at. </p>

<p> If you know nothing about building wheels, you'll find this an
immensely useful book. I wish I had read it before building my first
wheel. I learned how to build wheels by looking at a couple of how-to
guides: Sheldon Brown's <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html">instructions</a>
and the notes from Edinburgh Bicycle's wheelbuilding course. While
these guides told me what to do, they didn't tell me why. If you read
this book before building your first wheel you'll approach it with
confidence: you'll understand the materials and methods that make a
strong, durable wheel rather than a trendy wheel. However, it is
useful to ask your friends (or a newsgroup) about specific brands of
hubs, spokes, and rims, as this isn't in the book. Also, those who
aren't familiar with parts of bicycles may need a glossary to figure
out what some of the words (like "flange") mean. </p>

<p> The book is plenty useful even if you've built a few wheels or
have spent some time reading newsgroup or mailing list threads on
wheels. There is a great deal of misinformation out there. For
example, many mountain bikers feel that they need thick,
straight-guage spokes to have durable wheels.  This is not the
case. Brandt explains why swaged spokes (which are thinner in the
middle) make more durable wheels than straight-gauge spokes, and shows
why under most circumstances it's better to have more spokes that are
thinner rather than a smaller number that are thicker. Thus, for the
ultimate in strength, make a wheel with 36 (or even more!)  thin
swaged spokes. </p>

<p> I've also read things like "radially spoked wheels give a harsher
ride than a 3-cross pattern", and "you should use Loctite on the
non-drive side of a rear wheel to prevent it from coming loose". 
Topics like this can be hotly discussed on newsgroups, and it can
sometimes be hard to judge which side is right. This book will give
you the understanding you need to sort out these arguments. </p>

<p> When I read this book, I'd made about half a dozen wheels, all of
which are working fine. Now that I had some experience, I wanted hints
on how to make my wheels even better. As I read the book, I was
somewhat disappointed to find that it suggests doing things almost
exactly the way I have been doing them, using exactly the same
materials. Brandt recognizes this:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Cyclists who choose to build wheels often want something more than
ordinary, but just building wheels conventionally is not a trivial
task if a durable wheel is the goal. It may be disappointing to
discover that "it's all been done before" and that conventional wheels
are a result of a hundred years of refinement. The true contribution
for the new wheel builder is to build conventional wheels
exceptionally well.</p></blockquote>

<p> The main practical thing I got out of it was an emphasis on stress
relieving and correcting the spoke line: I realized that I hadn't been
doing it as carefully as I could. Despite not having learned any
radical new approaches to wheelbuilding, it was still worthwhile
reading.  In addition to seeing the importance of stress relieving I
now have a good understanding of how a wheel works and why the general
method I have been using is good (after having read about some of the
alternatives). I am also much more aware of wheels than I used to
be. I can now get a good idea of the quality of a wheel by looking at
the parts its made from and plucking the spokes. </p>
