<blockquote>
<p> I'm selling the first MTB I ever bought, the Trek 950 that inspired my
article <a href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/purple.html">My
Purple Problem</a> and which took me reliably around <a
href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/travel/wales/">Wales</a> in
2000.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Why am I selling it?</h4>

<blockquote> <p> In 2000 I bought a full suspension MTB, a <a
href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/images/gaddings.jpg">Marin
Rift Zone</a>. I meant to sell the Trek then, but then took is for one
last fling around Wales in July. Since then it has been sitting in the
garage getting very little use. It was time to sell
it. </p></blockquote>


<h4>Size</h4>

<blockquote>
<p> It's the 16.5" model. I'm 5'5" and it fits me perfectly. It would
probably do for someone a bit smaller or bigger than I am. The only
way to tell is to try it out!</p></blockquote>

<h4>Bike summary</h4>

<blockquote> <p> This is a very well used MTB. It has had plenty of
use, but as the frame and the components are of very high quality
(most of the components have been been replaced twice) it has plenty
life left in it. The best use for this bike is off-road riding. It is
too good a bike, and too nice looking, to be used just to ride around
town. The ideal purchaser of this bike is a woman, small man, or
teenager who wants to try out serious offroad riding and wants a
quality bike without paying a fortune. </p></blockquote>

<h4>Price</h4>

<blockquote><p>300 pounds or best offer. Buyer must collect from
Cambridge or pay shipping. </p></blockquote>
