<h1> Wet and Cold in Cambridgeshire </h1>

<p> I finally decided that I was going to put a suspension fork put on my
MTB. I did quite a bit of research to find a good fork, listening to
the fork chatter on the MTB mailing list, reading reviews, noting what
the local MTBers had on their bikes. Finally I chose a Pace fork, and
on Wednesday I got it installed. And so I was very eager for yesterday
(Thursday) evening's MTB ride. </p>

<p> It rained all day yesterday, a moderately cold rain. It was still
raining and about 7C (45F) as I headed out to the meeting place for
the ride. I waited.  No one showed, and I thought, it it weren't for
wanting to try out this new fork, I'd just go home. Finally, just
before 7:30 Peter showed up. Peter's a quiet modest man, and with his
rigid Rockhopper and toe clips, he is one of the best riders in the
group. He's one of the few people on the ride that I cannot keep up
with when he's going at his own pace. </p>

<p> We waited a bit to see if anyone else would show. Soon Jacob rolled
up, on his touring bike with full mudguards. He said "I'm wimping out
and staying on the roads, see you at the pub in Babraham". And so we
set off. </p>

<p> This was the first time I'd done one of these evening rides since
daylight savings time began. When we started out it was dusk, and it
was very strange going on these tracks actually being able to see
beyond the pool of my lights. It was a little disconcerting, since
there wasn't enough light to see clearly, but my lights didn't help.
Then it got dark and my eyes adjusted to it, and my lights were plenty
enough to show the way. </p>

<p> At first I was feeling really good. My Gore-Tex socks were keeping my
feet dry, and I was enjoying the much smoother ride offered by my
suspension fork. At first I kept right up with Peter, but later, as we
got into some little hills, he would pull away from me a bit as we
went along and would wait for me at all intersections. Happily, he
didn't have to wait very long, as I'm not that much slower than he
is. I soon found that with the constant splashing, my feet were
getting wet. The rest of me was too, but I managed to stay more or
less warm. </p>

<p> When we went down the traditional path along the Roman Road we
took the little side track that twists its way thru' the woods. The
fork handled the tree roots really well. I did hit one at an angle and
as it was slippery, instead of going over it, it shoved my wheel
left. I leaned left and got control of the bike just before it grazed
a treetrunk. A little bit of adventure never hurt anyone... </p>

<p> After maybe 12 miles of riding, we went on a section I'd never
been on before. It's called Rivey Hill, and at 112 meters, it is
very high for Cambridgeshire (OK so it's flat in these parts). There's
a bridleway that goes down the side of it, dropping down to about 50
meters over the course of about 1 kilometer. I could see the lights of
the village below, and as I went down it was exciting to note that I'd
already descended a fair ways, and was still quite a bit above them!
(Do you sense some hill deprivation here?) </p>

<p> I went really slowly down this hill. I had taken off the clear glasses
I use for night riding since I really couldn't see anything with them
being all wet and fogged. As I looked down the hill to come I thought
I'd better put them on to avoid muddy water splattering in my eyes.
Instead of doing something sensible like stopping to put them on I
tried to get them on while still moving. When I had finally acheived
that, I struggled to find a way that they could protect my eyes and
yet still allow me to see. I tried putting them on the end of my nose,
granny style. The idea was that water would come from the wheel and
splat on the glasses, and I'd look out over them. But they were too
tall, I couldn't see over them. So I put them back into my pocket.
Drat. I went slower than I would usually, partly because it was wet
and squishy, partly because I was uncertain about how the shock would
work, partly because I wanted to avoid throwing too much water at my
eyes, partly because this was my first time down this hill and I
didn't know what to expect. Or maybe these were all just excuses and I
was just being a wuss. </p>

<p> There were several tracks heading down. Peter had chosen the
middle one. I followed that for a bit. Then I thought I'd try the
grassy area to the left of all the tracks. I braked almost to a stop,
not wanting to cross the ruts at speed. The grassy area worked
fine. Until the field full of tall plants crept closer and closer,
finally coming right up to the edge of the leftmost rut. Darn. I braked
almost to a stop and got back onto Peter's track and made my way the
rest of the way down. </p>

<p> During all this Peter had kept on going at his own good pace, the gap
between us steadily widening, so by the time I finally got to the
bottom he'd been there a while. Oh, well.  </p>

<p> I realized that I was really cold once we got moving. I'd cooled off
coming down the hill. My hands were really bad. They were so soaked
that if I made a fist the water streamed off... Eventually I realized
that this was probably a bad idea: the water in my gloves had gotten
warmed up, and if I squeezed them out it was replaced by cold water. </p>

<p> We got to the intersection of a main road. Peter couldn't remember
which way to go. I wasn't quite sure where we were, so I couldn't
help. There was a petrol station nearby, so we went there and Peter
asked. So we headed in that direction and soon turned onto a road
signposted "Hildersham". Hildersham? I thought we were supposed to be
going to Babraham... Peter thought about it. Yep, we were supposed to
be going to Babraham. By that time both of us had more or less figured
out where we were, and we headed back the way we'd come, passed the
petrol station, and soon found the sign to Babraham, and then the pub
itself. </p>

<p> Jacob was wondering what had happened to us. We all commiserated about
the weather. We were completely drenched. We'd taken various
precautions for our feet, and had all been defeated. Jacob had
Gore-Tex boots, I had Gore-Tex socks, and Peter had gaiters and
Porelle Drys socks. I guess nothing would have worked in those
circumstances. As Jacob pointed out, they have the glaring drawback of
having a big hole at the top... </p>

<p> I figured I'd try to squeeze some of the water out of my gloves and
socks. There were some plants on the windowsill where we were sitting,
so I watered the plants. When I took off my Gore-Tex socks and turned
them upside down over the flowerpot, a little stream came out. Blah...
Around 10pm we put on all our cold wet gear for the trip back. It was
about 10 miles back to Cambridge. Soon after starting out my fingers
got cold. The worst came when we went down a little hill and the wind
speed combined with the wet hands to make them so painfully cold that
all I could think of was how much I hurt. But then as we travelled on,
me feeling miserable and sorry for myself, suddenly I realized that my
hands didn't hurt anymore. My blood was flowing again and I had warmed
them up. In fact probably the worst pain happened as they were coming
back to life... However, my feet continued their steady cooling off. </p>

<p> We pedalled on. Jacob peeled off as we headed into town, and Peter and
I carried on together for a bit longer, then he headed home. So I was
on my own for the last couple of miles. But home was near, and I
wasn't feeling so miserable. Finally I pulled up and Simon greeted me
at the door, saying he was worried about me, since it was getting on
towards 11pm. Usually when I'm on these night rides I leave the pub at
10, but they are generally not so far away so I'm back by 10:30. He
put my bike in the garage for me, and I started peeling off my wet
muddy clothes. I tried to get my feet warm, drying them off, rubbing
them, wiggling the toes. Finally they came back to life (ever so
painfully) in the shower and were feeling pretty normal by the time I
went to sleep. </p>

<p> Today the news was full of floods, and everyone thought I was nuts for
going out and mountain biking in that mess. Maybe, but looking back on
it, it was... well, not exactly fun, but it makes me feel good to face
a little adversity and to come out of it just fine. </p>

<p> <b>Lights</b> </p>

<p> Last night I was riding for something like 2 3/4 hours, with at
least one of my headlights burning all the time. I was glad that I
have a big, high-capacity battery (5 amp-hours) and that my low beam
light is only 6 Watts. This should theoretically give me 5 hours of
run time on the low beam, but with practice never meeting theory, and
the fact that I was using my high beam (10 W) along with the low beam
when we were off road, I was probably coming close to the capacity of
the battery. I believe stongly in having lots more battery capacity
than you think you'll need so if you end up being out longer than you
expect, you'll still make it home safely. My battery (Hawker Cyclon
lead-acid) weighs a kilogram, but it's worth it for the peace of
mind. </p>

<p> <b>Why I ride in the rain</b> </p>

<p> Upon reading the story above, a friend of mine mentioned that he
didn't like to ride in the rain because the forest rangers frown on
it. So I think I should add an explanation of why I <i>do</i> ride
in the rain. </p>

<p> This is an agricultural region. Trees are the exception ("That
little patch of trees we went through was nice!") rather than the
rule. We ride on private land, on tracks between fields. This is
completely legal. They are "rights of way", marked on the maps by red
dotted lines. They are the result of hundreds of years of tradition
(people walking and riding horses between fields to get from one
village to another). </p>

<p> The paths around here are for the most part very unexciting. The only
people that ride on them are (a) families or young couples on cheap
bikes on sunny warm weekend days, or (b) dirt junkies like myself and
my fellow night-riders. </p>

<p> Tractors do much much much more damage to the tracks than we do.
Horses come in second. </p>

<p> Thus we do little to no damage to the environment, especially in
comparison to other users, and no one minds us riding around, even in
the middle of a downpour. Seriously. </p>

<p> In more scenic areas of Britain (the Lake District, for example)
there are plenty of problems with erosion, overuse, macho bikers going
too fast and annoying walkers, etc, but there is none of that where I
live. </p>
