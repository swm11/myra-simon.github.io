<p>My second LeTour bike. This picture was taken (in 1985) on a ferry
while on a tour of New York State. As you can see, my method of
carrying luggage was pretty poor. With large rear panners, large
handlebar bag, and the bag on the top of the rack, the bike was very
top-heavy and fell over easily.</p>
