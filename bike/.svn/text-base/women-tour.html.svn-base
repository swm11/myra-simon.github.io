<h1>An inexpensive touring/leisure bike</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> To set the context of this article, what do I mean here by
"touring/leisure bike"? Basically, I mean a tough versatile bike for
general road riding and occasional light off-tarmac duty, like on dirt
roads, gravel-surfaced paths, and reasonably smooth trails. It can be
used for touring, commuting, day rides, short fun rides, whatever you
want. The emphasis is on comfort, enough comfort to spend all day in
the saddle, not on speed. It should have a reasonably upright
riding position and a variety of hand positions. </p>

<p> Since you may want to go on long tours it has the capacity to attach
front and rear pannier racks, and since you can never predict the
weather, it should be able to take mudguards (fenders).  It has a wide
variety of gears, lower than on a traditional racing style bike, to
enable you to go up steep hills with lots of luggage. To make shifting
easier, it should have the shift levers close to your hands. It should
have mountain bike style brakes to give you more clearance for wider
tires and fenders. </p>

<p> The traditional bike that satisfies all these criteria is called,
not surprisingly, a touring bike, and it looks pretty much like my
old touring bike to the right. It has 700c wheels, drop handlebars, a
triple chainring, and a full complement of racks and bags. It does the
job well. </p>

<p> However, this sort of bike does not suit all people. Many people
like a much more upright position than you can get on this sort of
bike. Also, they prefer the fingertip shifting and braking you get
with mountain bike type levers. The solution, then, is to make over a
mountain bike. </p>

<p> Mountain bikes can be configured to give you a much more upright
riding position than traditional touring bikes. They don't in general
have shorter top tubes, but it is easy to find stems that raise the
handlebars up by quite a bit, while not putting them forward very much
(see the info on mountain bike stems in <a href="bodge.html">Bodge
Your Bike to Fit</a>). Furthermore, mountain bike bars are straight,
meaning that the brakes are accessible from the part that is closest
to you, while bar ends allow you to change hand position and stretch
out a bit when it isn't necessary to have your hands next to the
brakes. </p>

<p> Not all mountain bikes are suitable for conversion for
tour/leisure use. I used a Fisher AL-1 (the green bike above) but I
wanted to find a modern bike suitable for conversion.  Looking around
in my local bike shops, I found that the Trek 920 suited this purpose
perfectly. It has an excellent steel frame, and while the bits on it
aren't top notch they are functional and can be replaced with better
quality ones when they wear out. It has all the attachment points you
need to put on racks and mudguards, and it has a threadless headset,
allowing maximum choice of replacement stems. I'll use pictures of the
920 to illustrate the list of things to look for. [Sadly, Trek
discontinued the 900 series bikes many years ago, so the 920 doesn't
exist any more. Furthermore, nowadays it's pretty hard to find a MTB
without front suspension. However, there are some, and they are worth
searching out. Since, the picturesof the Trek 920
illustrate what you should be looking for, so I'll continue to use it
as an example.]</p>

<p> First, you should look for a good frame. Since this bike will be
used mainly for on-road use, it will last basically forever, so make
sure you get a good quality, not too heavy frame that fits you
correctly. See <a href="mtb-advice1.html">A beginner's guide to buying
a mountain bike</a> for info on this. </p>

<p> Then check out the fork. It should be a rigid fork, not a
suspension fork. A bike without front suspension is better suited to
general purpose riding than a bike with a suspension fork: they are
lighter, cheaper (for the same quality of components), more reliable,
and less attractive to thieves. It's also easier to attach mudguards
and a front rack to a rigid fork. Make sure that the fork end has a
threaded hole in it and that it isn't too tall. Some forks on rigid
bikes are very tall to allow them to be upgraded with long travel
suspension forks. It is difficult to fit mudguards to these
forks. Make sure that there is a horizontal hole into the crown of the
forks, to allow you to attach the mudguard and possibly a dynamo
headlamp. Since the bike will almost certainly have V-brakes, make
sure that the hole is not too far above the cable that joins the tips
of the brakes together, as if it is the mudguard will interfere with
the brakes unless you bodge something to go between the mudguard
bracket and the hole. The fork doesn't need special braze-ons for a
front rack: Blackburn's well-respected Lowrider rack has loops that go
around the fork to anchor it in place. </p>

<p> Then check out the provisions in the rear section of the bike. You
need threaded holes attached to the rear dropout to fasten mudguards
and a rack. Look at the seatstays. While not absolutely essential,
threaded holes on the sides of the seatstays make rack mounting
easier. You also need either a hole through the seatstay bridge, or if
the bike has a wishbone fork, a hole through the wishbone or a
threaded hole on one side of the wishbone. Again, check the position
of this hole w.r.t. the cable joining the tips of the brakes. </p>

<p> The bike shop should swap the stem for a more upright one (if you
need it) for free. You'll also want some slick tires, which again the
shop should swap for free or very little money. I've been very happy
with the Tioga City Slicker tires, but there are quite a variety of
good slicks out there. A set of SKS mudguards will set you back less
than 25 pounds, a good rack 20 to 25 pounds, and some decent bar ends
less than 15 pounds. Since in my local shop the Trek 920 costs 370
pounds, the entire converted bike will cost about 430 pounds. </p>
