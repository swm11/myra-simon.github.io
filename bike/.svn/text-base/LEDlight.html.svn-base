<h1>Build a super-bright LED tail light</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> 

<p> My goal for this light was to have a simple, reliable, bright tail
light with a wide angle of visibility. I don't like flashing lights so
I wanted mine to have a steady on mode only. This made the circuit
much easier! The LEDs I chose were hyperbright wide angle LEDs. They
are actually two 30 degree red LED devices stuck together in one clear
plastic package, so the viewing angle is 60 degrees along one axis and
30 degees along the other. The resulting package has three leads; the
center one is the shared anode (gets the positive voltage), and the
two outer leads are the cathodes for the component LEDs (they get the
negative voltage). Note that the description of these LEDs in the
Maplin catalog is incorrect, as it says that the middle lead is the
common cathode. For my light I aligned the LEDs so that the 60 degree
axis was horizontal, giving lots of side visibility.  </p>

<p> The Maplin catalog seems to suggest that all the their ultrabright
and hyperbright LEDs should be run at 1.8V. However, they gave the
current at 1.8V as 20mA for all the LEDs, most of which were the usual
two-lead LEDs. I measured the current with 1.8V applied to both of the
component LEDs in my 3-lead LED and got 30-33mA. I used 30mA in my
calculations. </p>

<p> I planned to power this with my Lumicycle battery, which is a
13.2V NiMH battery. The idea is to have several LEDs in series with a
resistor to limit the current going through the LEDs. Theoretically, I
could have had 7 of the LEDs in a row (7 * 1.8V = 12.6V), with a
resistor to make up the remaining 0.6V. This would have resulted in a
resistor of 20ohms (R = V/I, where R = resistance in ohms, V = voltage
in volts, and I = current in amps). </p>

<p> However, the battery's voltage varies over its discharge cycle,
and using such a low-valued resistor would have allowed the current
through the LEDs to vary a great deal over the operating voltage of
the battery. So instead I used 6 LEDs, making 10.8V. To make up the
remaining 2.4V, I needed a resistor of 80ohms. The closest we had in
the box-o-resistors was 82ohms, so that's what went into the
circuit. </p>

<p> Since I wanted a fairly bright light, I used two strings, each of
which consisted of 6 LEDs and an 82ohm resistor, as shown in the
circuit diagram below: </p>

<p> The rectangles are the resistors, and the triangles with the
vertical lines at the point are the LEDs (the slanted lines coming
from them are meant to resemble light rays). The slanted line below
the "bat +" is the switch. The current flows in the direction the
triangle points (from left to right in the diagram). In diode
terminology, for each LED the anode is the side with the flat part of
the triangle, and it gets the positive voltage, while the cathode is
the part next to the vertical line, and is gets the negative
voltage. </p>

<p> If the battery you want to use has a different voltage than the
Lumicycle battery, or if you want to use different LEDs, you can use
similar reasoning to work out how many LEDs to have in a string and
the size of the current-limiting resistor. </p>

<p> One problem was what to put the circuit in. What I really needed
was a clear box, or at least a box with a clear lid. Maplin didn't
have any appropriate boxes, but I hit pay dirt in the Farnell
catalog. I used a bracket for a VistaLite 5-LED tail light to attach
the light to the seat post: I have a couple of these VistaLites
mounted directly to racks, so I had some spare mounts. </p>

<p> The electrical supply to the circuit was accomplished by an
in-line (i.e. attached to wires) 2.5/5.5mm power socket. I needed an
in-line socket because the Lumicycle power cord wasn't quite long
enough to reach the seat post. If your power cords are longer, you'll
be able to get away with using a panel-mount power socket mounted in
the side of your box. The 2.5/5.5mm power plugs used by Lumicycle are
common in the bike lighting world: I have owned VistaLite and
NiteRider systems that used the same size plug. However, make sure you
check what kind of power plug your battery has, and get a socket to
match.  In my parts list below I have included the in-line socket,
although I didn't really have to buy it (I had one already, salvaged
from an AC/DC converter). </p>

<p> The switch I used came from Maplin. It seems to be very similar to
the toggle switches used in Lumicycle lighting heads. The switch has
two positions and a very positive action: it doesn't jump from one
position to the other with jolting caused by riding off-road. It
actually has three contacts on the bottom: in one switch position the
switch connects the middle contact to one side contact, and in the
other position the middle is connected to the other side. I soldered
it up with the positive connection of the battery going to the middle
contact, and the positive voltage supply to the circuit coming from
one of the side contacts. I also got a rubber waterproof switch cover
to keep the circuit dry. </p>

<p> Well, that's about it. Drilling holes in the box, installing the
socket and switch and wiring everything up was tedious but
straightforward. The result is a very bright, lightweight, robust
light that consumes about 0.8W of power. (P = IV, P = power in watts,
I = current in amps, V = voltage; for my light voltage was 13.2V and
current was .06 amps because I'm using two strings in parallel.) You
can see it all wired up below. </p>

<h3> Part numbers</h3>

<p> All the parts came from either <a href="https://catalogue.maplin.co.uk/">
Maplin</a> or <a
href="http://www.farnell.co.uk/Welcome/welcome-frame-unregistered.jhtml">
Farnell</a>. </p>

<p> In the above table I haven't accounted for things like wires,
resistors, and the mounting bracket, as we already had these. The total
cost was 23.44 UKP. Quite favorable in comparison to say the NiteRider
tail light, which is somewhere around 50 quid! </p>
