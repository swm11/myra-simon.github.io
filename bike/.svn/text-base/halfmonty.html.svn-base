<h4>Part I</h4>

<p><i>Thanks to Tony Raven, Matt Wenham, and Jon Wyatt for the

<p>
Matt Wenham was hosting one of his Bank Holiday MTB weekends in
Calderdale Valley in the South Pennines. It had been a good weekend
of riding. It was the first serious workout I'd given my new
full suspension bike, a Marin Rift Zone, and I'd ridden better than
ever before. Was it the bike?  Was it me? I don't know, but I found
myself riding things I'd never done before. My concentration was good
most of the time, and I was doing well at scoping out lines and holding
the bike on them, especially on the uphills. Not that I'm at all
fast, mind, but I was spending more time on the bike and less time
bumping my wheels into random rocks.
</p>

<p>
For the Bank Holday Monday Matt had planned a special treat: the
Full Monty.  Yes! 45 miles of technical Pennine tracks, replete
with lung-busting technical uphills, flats made unridable with masses
of rock, and downhills with tricky dropoffs. It sounded good, but it
wasn't for me. I know my limits. The Half Monty was more my style. Matt
suggested a route of about 30 miles (so more of a 2/3 Monty, really)
and Vince volunteered to lead it. We were all set.
</p>

<p>
On the day Shaun's group were taking their time getting ready, so
Matt's group started out. We headed out of Walsden on a road that goes
roughly east, up to North Hollingworth Farm. (I'll try to describe
this route well enough that you can follow it on a map. The map to use
is OS Outdoor Leisure 21.)  This is an incredibly steep tarmac
climb. At the top it's 1 in 4, and I usually have trouble keeping my
front wheel on the ground. I was tempted to get off and walk,
especially as three day's riding had made my legs heavy, but I'm
stubborn enough that I stayed on the bike, sweating it out.
</p>

<p>
At the top, at the farm, we turned left onto a northbound
bridleway. This is fairly smooth dirt for a bit, but soon we got onto
the dreaded Packhorse Stones.  Quite some time ago, large slabs were
put down to stop the erosion caused by horses' feet. The slabs remain
to prevent erosion and challenge the biker.
</p>

<p>
They're not so bad descending, but on a sharp incline the unevenness
or occasional missing slab can be too much for a biker who's just
managing the lungpower to get up the hill. I didn't do as well here as
I have before.  I've found that If I have a bit of spare energy I can
usually get through the tricky bits by concentrating and putting out a
bit more power, but three days' riding had taken their toll and my
legs ached too much to put out the effort.

<p>
Finally, we were at Rake End, the top of the climb. Matt had suggested
continuing on the Packhorse Trail, riding along a road for a bit, and
then picking up London Road at Mankinoles. But I wanted a real
challenge.  At my request we turned east and followed a footpath up to
Gaddings Dam. I surprised myself by riding most of this, and reached
the top feeling good. I had warmed up by this time, and the ache had
started to leave my legs.
</p>

<p>
The ride along the top of the north side of the dam was as fun as
ever, requiring focus to keep the bike on the narrow ruts and choose
the correct track to avoid the deep puddles. We followed the track as
it left the dam.  This track is mostly level, and it starts out
ridable, livened up by a healthy dose of rocks to dodge. Eventually
though the rocks take over, and ridable sections end up being short
interludes between heaps of stones.  (The way is clear on the
ground, but I'm not sure which of the many footpaths on the map it is.)
</p>

<p>
I tried to ride one section I hadn't attempted before: it was a
narrow track across the top of a gully, preceded by a sharp turn. I
managed the turn and got partway across the gully, but didn't manage to
keep the bike in the slightly recessed track. My front wheel hit the
edge, and the bike stopped. I started to fall sideways. Now, I'm pretty
good at landing on my feet, so I unclipped and started looking for a
place to put my foot down. But I was falling to the left, into the
gully, and there was nothing there. The bike and I fell. I rolled head
over heels a couple of times and then stopped. I was lying flat on
some very thick grass. My bike was below me, chainrings towards me. My
bum was right next to the chainset, and I felt a small pain in my bum
where the teeth had ripped a small hole and scratched me. Later my
boyfriend was very amused to learn that I'd scratched my bum with my
chainrings... Other than this I was uninjured, so I hauled myself and
my bike up and continued on.

<p>
Eventually the trail joined the Pennine Way on the way to Stoodley Pike. This
is a good section of trail. It varies from extremely difficult to easy if
you're good at dodging rocks. The ominous clouds that had been threatening us
for awhile had given way to wet hail, and we rode on, the icy particles
bouncing off our helmets. At least we didn't get too cold: the day had
started off quite cool so we were prepared.
</p>

<p>
This kind of weather can be very demoralizing, and it was too much for
Arthur, a roadie who's just gotten a MTB. Despite being much more fit
than I am, he was walking even more than I was, and the hail was
getting him down even more. He said he couldn't concentrate, couldn't
see, and so he bailed, taking the Calderdale Way down to the road and
thence back to Matt's place. I was trying to be positive: I'd noted how
every day over the weekend it had rained at one point, but had then
gotten brightly sunny for the rest of the afternoon. I hoped that today
would be the same, and plodded on. I managed to keep my concentration
and rode reasonably well, despite the water drops on my glasses and the
sleet stinging my face.
</p>

<p>
About this time we noticed Shaun's group coming along the trail,
and gradually they caught up with us.
</p>

<p>
Getting to Stoodley Pike, I joined the others nestled up to it out of
the wind. The sleet abated a bit, and we headed out. We took the
footpath heading east from Stoodley Pike, over a stile, then north to
join London Road. On one bit of this we were following a small stream
down the side of the hill. There was a very nasty looking dropoff,
and a narrow path to the left of it. I took the little path very
slowly, but stopped when something in the rear of my bike got hung
up. I looked back. It was my rear derailleur. Suddenly I recalled Matt
talking about this one bit of track where several people had ripped
off their rear derailleurs on a strategically placed rock. Hmmmm,
maybe going slowly has its advantages.
</p>

<p>
We followed London Road (which becomes Kilnshaw Lane) eventually turning left
down a steep slope and joining a part tarmac, part cobbled road to Hebden
Bridge. We invaded the cafe at the train station and feasted on tea and
sandwiches, about 7 miles accomplished.

<p>
It rained a bit more while we were at the station, but cleared up.
Eventually, fortified by Yorkshire tea, we headed out. Some people packed it
in after the cafe, leaving only the real hard nuts who were doing the Full
Monty (Shaun, Matt, and a few others), and the part nuts who were doing the
Half Monty (Vince, Tony, John, and myself).
</p>

<p>
The Montyites started out together out of Hebden Bridge, up the
A6033. Soon our group branched off to the left while Matt and his gang
headed straight up. We came to a to a National Trust property, and we
followed a broad smooth trail up through the trees, with Hebden Water
to our left. The sun was shining over the treetops. Occasionally the
wind would shake a few drops off the leaves, and we'd worry that the
rain had started again. We told jokes to pass the time as we slowly
climbed.
</p>

<p>
We passed Hardcastle Crags, then emerged from the trees, joining a wide
smooth flat bridleway near Walshaw. We headed west. This was
easy riding. There was a mild headwind, but bright sunshine. We chatted
as we rolled along, enjoying the day.  We dropped down to cross a
small stream (Alcomden Water), then climbed up the other side. A couple
of left turns on tarmac and we were at the Packhorse Inn, where we
stopped for a bite to eat. 15 miles down, 15 to go.
</p>

<p>
Tony and I ordered food while Vince and John ate from their
Camelbaks. We sat outside since there were no tables free indoors, and
stretched out our legs, letting the sun warm up the black lycra. We
told more jokes. Eventually we began to wonder where the food had got
to: 45 minutes had gone by already. We asked and were told it would
take another 10 to 15 minutes. We contemplated cancelling our orders,
but decided not to: what was the rush? The weather was fine and looked
like it would hold, so we waited. Eventually the food came.  We ate
and got going again.
</p>

<h4>Part III</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>
We headed along tarmac to the Widdop Reservoir. We rode along the
south edge of this, then headed up the Gorple Gate. I remembered this
from years back, from my first ride in the area.  Then I was frustrated
at not being able to ride what was essentially a dirt road, and I
expected to do better this time.
</p>

<p>
I can't say that my expectations were met. I did ride most of it until
the first switchback, but then it was hopeless. I walked the rest of
the steep bit. At the top I got back on the bike and flew along the
smooth but rock-infested track. We went up a small rise, then turned
left (south) onto the permissive bridleway the follows Rams Clough.
</p>

<p>
This was fairly boggy, but quite ridable. Soon the track turned west and
became a fun roller coaster of a ride through small grassy hills. I thought,
this is what mountain biking is all about: out with your friends on a good
day, flying along great tracks in the sunshine.

<p>
Eventually we came to Cant Clough Reservoir. We followed the edge of this,
then headed south, still following the permissive bridleway. The last time I
was here I found this very difficult. Flat bits alternate with climbs, some
quite loose, and by the time I got to the top I had about had it. This time I
did much better, riding smoothly and steadily. I only had trouble with one
section. It was a loose slope which got looser an steeper at one point. I
told myself I was going to make it up this bit, so I poured on the power and
made it up. And then, over the difficult bit, I had to stop to catch my
breath: it had consumed all my reserves of energy.
</p>

<p>
Finally we went past the wind farm and joined the road (The Long Causeway).
We headed southeast, following the road as it swept a bit north to follow the
contours. I was beginning to feel a bit draggy here, and I dropped behind a
bit.
</p>

<p>
At the point where the road returns to a straight line we turned right
and down the hill. Near Lower Mount Farm we turned left onto a
bridleway. This track is reasonably easy to follow on the map, as it
heads gradually southeast towards Cross End. It joins up with the
Calderdale Way for a bit before heading off past the golf course. It's
a scenic track between stone walls, with good views of farmland. It's
especially nice in August, when the heather is blooming. It is
challenging in places because of deep mud.
</p>

<p>
After powering through one of these bits my little chainring started
acting up. I would pedal hard, then when I was applying the most
pressure the chain would cling to the chainring, pulling the rear
derailleur taut. The pedals would stop turning and I would come to an
abrupt halt. After a few episodes of this I resigned myself to
completing the ride without the little ring.

<p>
Eventually we came to some some packhorse stones which we rode down,
then through a few gates. After the last gate you turn right to go
down a wide dirt track with a few water bars through the trees. It's
tempting to get up a great deal of speed on this bit and let it carry
you all the way down the hill, but there's more singletrack to
come. When you emerge from the trees and the dirt road bends right,
you need to leave the wide track and go up the steep rocky track on
the other side of the tall rock wall in front of you. This often
leaves people unprepared, and they struggle to shift down while going
up this steep slope.
</p>

<p>
I knew what was coming, but since my granny gear wasn't working I could only
shift down to the biggest cog on the middle ring. I would only make it up if
I stood up. I steeled myself and ground up, succeeding probably because I
regularly ride a fixed gear bike.
</p>

<p>
Then we went down a ways, over a few small dropoffs, and past the
golf course. We turned right on the road after the golf course, then
left, heading east. We were still some ways above the valley, and we
weren't going to lose that height on the road.

<p>
As the road turned north we turned right onto a bridleway heading east.
Initially there is a wall on the left and a very steep grassy dropoff. For
some reason this section of the trail really bothers Tony. Admittedly it
wouldn't do you any good if you went over the edge, but the track is 
easy, so there's little danger off alling off.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the track soon goes down, with vegetation to the left and right,
forming a canopy overhead. There's one steep rocky dropoff here that I've
never tried. This time was no exception. There's a bit more riding, then the
track rises steeply and gets unridable. Normally I'd give it a go anyway,
but without a granny gear I didn't even try. I pushed up to a smooth dirt
track.

<p>
We continued right on the track, then turned right again towards a farm. The
bridleway goes between a couple of buildings, and then starts THE DESCENT. On
the map, this is the zig-zaggy bit between Rodwell End and the picnic area on
the A646. It goes steeply down, starting with a few gentle dropoffs, then a
big one. Then there's a sharp switchback, lots of difficult dropoffs, and
another switchback. After this it's ridable.
</p>

<p>
I'd been here lots of times before. The first time I saw this I was sure it
was completely unridable, and for many times since nothing had revised my
opinion of this. I had never gotten past the first difficult dropoff: always
someone would falter just ahead of me, and I'd lose my bottle.
</p>

<p>
However, the last time down there, the previous day, I'd done more of it than
before. I had faltered at the first dropoff as usual, but I'd gotten back on
and gone around the switchback, and gone over the first dropoff after that.
Then I'd chickened out at the most difficult dropoff, but then did all the
other ones after that. I had gone around the second switchback and then down
the rest of the way.
</p>

<p>
That evening, over dinner, Matt mentioned the trick to doing the
most difficult dropoff after the first switchback. There is a big rock,
and you have to go either to the left or the right of it. You make
your choice, and you do it...
</p>

<p>
This day, I was almost at the end of the Half Monty, and I was tired. I had
told myself I wasn't going to try anything difficult on these switchbacks,
but as I neared it I determined to make it down to the first switchback.
There was no one directly ahead of me, so I had a clear run. I rode
carefully, and I did it. I got to the first switchback. There I found John
and Vince stopped as John wanted to have another go at the tough dropoffs.
</p>

<p>
I stopped. There was nothing to prove here, I'd done that
switchback the previous day. John and Vince headed off down. I let them
go, and then I went.  I did the first little dropoff then came to the
big rock. I decided to go left around it. I guided the bike around,
and made it through that section. My concentration was good, and I
kept the bike on track, gently going over the remaining tricky
dropoffs. I got to the second switchback desperately not wanting to
screw up after having done the difficult bits. Very slowly, I inched
around. Then I was home free. I let off the brakes a bit and flew down
to the picnic area. I had ridden the Rodwell End switchbacks! I was
elated.  We chatted for a bit, then rode back along the canal to
Matt's place. I felt good all the way back: very tired, but satisfied.
</p>

<p>
When we got back we found that Matt had gotten back just a bit before we had.
They'd been too tired and had left out the Gorple Gate. So the Fully Monty
was only 38 miles. We had done 30, not so much less.
</p>

<p>
It was a good end to a long weekend of riding.
