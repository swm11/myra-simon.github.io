<p> Our daughter Ellen has been going places in the bike trailer since
before she was 2 months old. We have a Burley Solo trailer that we
strap a car safety seat into, and then Ellen goes into the car safety
seat. When she was 5 months old, we did a little cycle tour with her.
</p>

<p> I was looking for a nice place to go to that wasn't too far from
Cambridge and hit upon Bury St. Edmonds, which is roughly 25 miles due
east of Cambridge. I had heard it was a pretty town, with some
interesting history (there was a very important abbey there in
medieval times) and a big market in the center of town on Saturdays.
We decided to do it the weekend of Friday August 1st through Sunday
August 3rd: we would ride out on the Friday, spend Saturday exploring
the town, and ride back Sunday. We would take the tandem; that way we
would both work at pulling Ellen. </p>

<h4>Friday</h4>

<p> The first of August started cool and wet. We got everything ready
to go, loading up our panniers, as we watched the weather reports on
the Internet. The wet weather system was moving slowly east. We
thought, if we wait until it passes over it'll be dry for our ride
east. So we waited, and at about 12:30 it stopped raining, and we set
out. </p>

<p> Ellen fell asleep, as she often does in the trailer. Our plan was
to head to Newmarket, where we'd stop for lunch and would feed Ellen.
Feeding Ellen was one of my worries. She was still feeding exclusively
on breast milk, which was very convenient from a point of view of
always having food ready when travelling, but she was getting very
picky about where and when she would feed. Basically, she would only
feed where it was quiet and there were no distractions, and preferably
when we were lying down. I wondered if I would be able to feed her
well on this trip. </p>

<p> Immediately east of Cambridge it is still as flat as Cambridge
itself, and we made good time. But as we approached Newmarket it got
quite hilly, at least in comparison to what we are used to! It was
still quite damp and cool, so we didn't suffer from heat (in fact we
were wearing long tights and light jackets over our shorts and bike
shirts), but we still worked quite hard to get the tandem plus the
trailer plus our kit for the weekend up the hills. Still, we enjoyed
the quiet, pleasant scenery; the hills and trees make a very pleasant
contrast to flat treeless Cambridge. </p>

<p> Just a few miles from Newmarket, Ellen woke up. At first she just
made a few squeaking noises, but they got louder and more insistent
until eventually they were outright cries. We stopped and got her out
of the trailer and cuddled her. I thought about trying to feed her to
comfort her, but it didn't sound comfortable for me or her -- the only
place to sit was the still damp grass along the road. After a bit of
cuddling we put her back in the trailer and tried to ignore her
complaints as we rode on. By the time we got to Newmarket she'd fallen
back asleep. </p>

<p> In Newmarket we found a Bakers Over sandwich shop to feed
ourselves. Service was slow and we didn't get what we'd asked for, but
they gave us part of our meal for free to make up for it. They had a
changing area, so we put a new nappy on Ellen, but my attempts to feed
her were unsuccessful -- she would take a few sucks and then just
cry. We needed a place to feed her. </p>

<p> After our lunch I went scouting. I found a public library, where I
thought I might be able to find a comfy chair in a quiet place. Simon
sat on a bench outside, with the bike leaning nearby, while I took
Ellen in. I found a good chair in (suitably enough!) the children's
section of the library! She settled down and had a good feed, and fell
asleep. I took her back out, and Simon told me that many people had
admired our setup as he sat there. I guess a tandem is pretty rare,
and a bike trailer is pretty rare, and so a tandem pulling a bike
trailer is a rare event indeed! </p>

<p> Now that all of us had been well fed we headed on. We headed
pretty much due east from Newmarket to get to Bury St. Edmunds. Ellen,
contented, went back to sleep, and we pedalled on. We'd told the B&B
lady that we'd be there around 6pm, and it was clear that we weren't
going to make it. When we were in Barrow, about 6 miles from Bury
St. Edmunds, we phoned her up to ler her know we'd be about half an
hour late. She said that she was surprised that we were coming at all,
considering the weather! We told her that we'd been fine, as the rain
had passed by the time we left, and we'd had a dry trip. </p>

<p> We rode on and found the B&B safely. It was on the west wide of
town, making for easy access. We had showers, gave Ellen a good feed,
and had dinner in the B&B. We'd done about 32 miles that day. </p>

<h4>Saturday</h4>

<p> After breakfast we headed into town, locking up the bike & trailer
by the bike racks behind the Boots in the center of town. We put Ellen
in the sling to take her around. Bury St. Edmunds has the largest open
air market in East Anglia, so we wandered around looking at the
stalls. The market was nice, but nothing spectacular. I guess I'm
spoiled living in Cambridge: there is a market in the center of town 6
days a week (and there are arts & craft stalls there on the 7th day)
so being able to buy things from an open-air stall in a city center is
no big deal. I guess the nicest thing about the day was the weather --
nice and warm but not too hot, and brightly sunny. </p>

<p> We wandered around the town, taking in the Abbey gardens and the
ruins of the Abbey (<a
href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/swmpics/2003/pics.cgi?dir=swmpics/2003/MiniCycleTourAug2003">here
are lots more pictures</a>), enjoying the day. We tried, entirely
unsuccessfully, to feed Ellen in the gardens. It was quiet, but either
there were too many distractions or she wasn't comfortable
enough. Either way, she just cried. I felt really bad -- this is my
baby, and I'm not taking care of her. I felt like a failure. </p>

<p> We had a late, large lunch in a nice restaurant called the Bay
Tree on St. Johns Street. They had an upstairs area with a confy
couch. It was quite hot up there, but there was an area with a couple
of big comfy couches, and we thought Ellen would like the chance to
get out and wiggle around after having been confined in the
sling. After having our lunch I tried to feed her. She managed to find
a comfy position and latched on and had a good feed. I felt much
better. Maybe I'm not a failure of a mother after all. </p>

<p> After our lunch we wandered around the town a bit more, taking in
more of the sights (including The Nutshell, the smallest pub in
Britain, so says the visitor's guide) and going for a longish walk
which started in the Abbey and went along a small stream, coming back
past the rugby grounds. When we came back from our walk the shops were
closing. We decided to have a simple dinner, so we got from bread and
salads from Marks and Spencer just before they shut, and we headed
back to our B&B. After showers, we chowed down on our food in the B&B
garden, relaxing after having been on our feet virtually all
day. Feeding Ellen in the B&B wasn't a problem, as it was quiet and
not too hot and we could lie down. </p>

<h4>Sunurday</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> On Sunday we headed back, but not the direct way. I'd read in the
visitor's guide that there was a recreated Anglo-Saxon village, West
Stow, about 6 miles northwest of town. To go to it we'd have to go a
little bit out of our way, but I decided that would be a good
thing. If we went back more or less the same way we came, taking a
reasonably direct route, we'd hit the same hills we got on the way
out. Since it promised to be a hot and sunny day, sweating it up steep
hills didn't appeal to me. I thought there was a good chance of it
being much flatter if we took a more northernly route, and if we did
that the Anglo-Saxon village would be pretty much on the way. </p>

<p> So we went to West Stow and learned something about the people who
lived there (it was occupied between the 5th and 7th centuries).
Afterwards we went to the cafe next to the visitor center for some
lunch. Again I tried to feed Ellen, but she wasn't having it and just
cried when I tried. So we set off, and she fell asleep again. </p>

<p> By the time we left West Stow it was getting hot, and it just kept
getting hotter and hotter. We both thought we could use a break, but
Ellen was asleep and I wanted to get as far as we could while she
slept. Finally we were in Burwell, about 10 miles from home. We tried
to drop by to visit our friend Kate, but she wasn't home, so instead
we got some ice creams and juice from the nearby grocery store and went
to the nearby recreation ground to relax. It was amazing how much
cooler it felt sitting in the grass in the shade of the trees than it
was cycling on the road.  We pulled Ellen out of the trailer and let
her wiggle around on a blanket on the grass. I tried to get her to
feed, with limited success -- at least she had a short feed. </p>

<p> We headed off, and Ellen wasn't very happy. She started making
small complaints which got louder and louder until she was really
crying by the time we got to Swaffham Prior. There are few things more
distressing than the sound of your baby crying, so we pulled off the
road and took her out of the trailer, cuddled her (not the most
pleasant of things in on a hot day) and tried to feed her. She calmed
down but still didn't look too happy. Eventually we put her back in
the trailer and headed on. She complained a bit, but then fell asleep
for the rest of the way back. </p>

<p> Once back in Cambridge I gave her a good feed and she felt
better, and so I did too. We'd done about 40 miles in some pretty
unpleasant heat. </p>

<p> All in all our mini-cycle tour went well. The main problem was
Ellen being so picky about when and where she would feed, which lead
to alot of frustration on my part and hers. Add to that the heat of
the trip back, and I was worrying about her getting dehydrated. I
think that if I were doing a cycle tour again with a baby, I'd do it
earlier in the year when it wasn't so hot! </p>
