<h1>Mountain Bike Bog Snorkelling</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> I was the 2000 Women's World Champion Mountain Bike Bog Snorkeler. The
<i>what?</i> you ask. Well, it goes like this... </p>

<p> About 15 years ago, Gordon Green decided to attract some more
attention to <a
href="http://llanwrtyd-wells.powys.org.uk/index1st.htm"> Llanwrtyd
Wells</a>, Wales' smallest town, by creating the World Bog Snorkelling
Championships. In this event, competitors with mask, snorkel, and
scuba fins swim along a 60 meter trench cut through a peat bog. This
proved to be such a success that three years ago he came up with a
similar event for mountain bikers. </p>

<p> In the wheeled version, you start at one end of a pond filled with
very brown muddy water, cycle a specially modified bike around a pole,
then come back to the start. The bike is weighted so it stays down:
the frame has been filled with lead shot, the tires filled with water,
and lead weights are attached to a frame bag. You wear scuba weight
belts so you stay down, and you wear a mask and snorkel. The idea is
that your eyes are just about level with or slightly below the water,
but you can breathe through the snorkel.</p>

<p> For the first two years, MTB journalist Dave Atkinson (currently
art editor for What Mountain Bike) has won the event, and he was back
for the 2000 competition, which took place on the 15th of July. I was
there too. </p>

<p> I arrived as they were putting the finishing touches on the
course. I entered the competition and watched the practice runs. At
first I thought I wouldn't do any practice runs, after all I was the
only woman, so as long as I completed the course I was the winner of
the ladies competition. But I noticed the guys who practiced were
improving so I decided to try. I donned weights, mask &amp; snorkel
(attaching my glasses to a fence), adjusted the seat on the bike, and
went in.</p>

<p>It was cold, but adrenaline kept me from getting too chilled. I
pedalled but found that the wheels slipped easily on the floor of the
bog. I kept at it and slowly crept forward. I couldn't see anything,
just this brown liquid outside the mask. Then as I got slightly deeper
I couldn't breathe. No problems, I'll come up. Ulp, what about those
weights? They were doing their job of keeping me down. I started to
panic. Luckily there were a couple of ambulance guys on hand, one in a
wetsuit. He jumped in. I normally don't jump straight into the arms of
handsome young strangers, but this was an exception.  He pushed me out
and hauled the bike out.</p>

<p>Gordon Green, the proprietor of the Neuadd Arms and the inventor of
this loony competition told me I had the snorkel on wrong: I had it
pointing backwards as you do for scuba, but it needs to be pointing
straight up. He realigned it and I tried again. Down the ramp and into
the bog. I made it to the pole and was about to start around it when I
couldn't breathe again. Despite being pointed up, the snorkel was
still under water. The guy in the wetsuit was nearby, and between the
two of us we got to shore again.</p>

<p>Well, that was enough for me. I watched the competition, cheering
on the snorkellers. There were some very good runs, and Dave was
probably getting a bit nervous, wondering if he could retain his
title. However, when he went in he was all business, and not only came
up with the winning time, but setting a new world record time of 1min
5sec as well!

<p>That would have been the end of it for me, but Gordon really wanted
a female champion this year. He said that they'd get the wetsuit guy
to stand in a shallower bit of the pool, and I could just go around
him. And they offered let me use a wetsuit. Well, allright. I put the
wetsuit on, donned the weights, adjusted the saddle, and went in
again. This time I was much warmer. The wetsuit was working. I was
finding it very difficult to ride, so I just pushed the bike around,
which was still quite hard. Eventually I made it around my human pole,
and I could get out of the water. It was a bit pathetic, but that's
all that was required to be Women's World Champion Mountain Bike Bog
Snorkeler. After it all, Dave Atkinson and I posed for photos.  Dave
got a glass beer mug, and I got a GT bicycles polo shirt.</p>
