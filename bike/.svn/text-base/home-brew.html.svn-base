<p> This article is somewhat out of date. The main problem with it is
that many of the lighting heads I recommend are no longer available.
Until I get around to bringing it up to date, I recommend you check
out some other DIY lights pages to see what they're using for
lighting heads.

<h4>My DIY lights</h4>

<p> I'm no electrical nor mechanial engineer, so the systems I describe
here are pretty easy to put together. They consist of
<ul> 
<li> commercial lighting heads
<li> 6V lead-acid or NiCad batteries
<li> cords to connect the batteries to the lights
<li> good chargers for the batteries
</ul></p>

<p> You only need normal basic tools (screwdrivers, etc) and a few
specialist electrical tools (a soldering iron and multimeter). </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h4>Lighting heads</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I like to use lighting heads that have the same type of connector,
a barrel connector with inner diameter 2.5mm and outer diameter
5.5mm. Many 6V commercial lighting heads come with this connector,
including the VistaLite 
<a href="http://www.vistalite.com/vis2a.htm">400</a> and 
<a href="http://www.vistalite.com/vis2b.htm">500</a> series lighting heads, 
<a href="http://www.niterider.com/products/products.html">NiteRider
6V systems</a>, and the 
<a href="http://www.specialized.com/">Specialized Proview</a>. </p>

<p> The VistaLite lighting heads are the easiest to get on their own,
since they are sold as separate products. The lighting head sold as
the VistaLite 400 (stand-alone 2W light requiring 4 AA batteries) is
exactly the same as that included in the VistaLite 410 (rechargeable
version of 400) and 420 and 430 lighting systems (which have one or
two lighting heads loaded with 10W bulbs and external lead-acid
batteries). It costs about £15. To use the VistaLite 400 in a
high-powered lighting system, replace the bulb with a 6W or 10W
bulb. You get get frosted 10W bulbs from a VistaLite dealer, but clear
6W or 10W bulbs are also useful.  In the UK you can get these clear
bulbs from Edinburgh Bicycle (you're looking for the Reflectalite
bulbs that go into 420 or 430 lighting systems). In the US try any
caving supply shop, such as <a href="http://www.caves.org/imo/">Inner
Mountain Outfitters</a>. You're looking for 6V Mini Edison Screw (MES)
bulbs. </p>

<p> The VistaLite 500 is a very small light lighting head, based on an
MR-11 bulb, and it's sold as an upgrade to the 420 and 430 lighting
systems (it's compatible with them in that the both have the same kind
of plug and operate at 6V). The VistaLite 500 head is also available
included in the VistaLite 520, 530 and 540 lighting systems. However,
it costs about £33.   <p>

<p> See the <a href="light-rev.html">Lighting Systems Review</a>
section for VistaLite 400 and VistaLite 500 systems to find more
detailed decriptions of these lighting heads (and about tradeoffs
between frosted and clear bulbs). If you can't find these products in
your local shops, find a shop that sells VistaLite products (rear
flashers are the most common) and get then to order the parts for
you. </p>

<p> Good alternatives to the VistaLite heads are the lighting heads
that come with the MR-11 based NiteRider 6V systems and Specialized
Proview. However, as far as I know, these are not products that you
can buy separately, although you may be able to order them from the
manufacturer as spare parts. They are still good alternatives if you
want to use a commerical lighting system as a starting point for your
system. For example, a NiteRider Pro-6 gives you an excellent 5
amp-hour water bottle battery and lighting head with 15W bulb. Of
course, you can also buy VistaLite systems as the starting point of
your lighting setup. </p>

<p> A particularly good starting point is the
Specialized Proview Alkaline, which consists of a lighting head,
water-bottle shaped battery case with power cord, helmet mount, and
waist pack for putting the battery case in if you want to carry it on
your body. They intend you to put 5 D-sized alkalines in the battery
case, but you can do your own thing. Options include putting in
NiCads, cutting the cord off and attaching it to a soldered-up NiCad
pack or to a lead-acid battery. It costs about £35, giving it real
value-for-money. </p>

<p> If you want a helmet light (a very good idea for off-road riding,
as it can be directed where you want it to see much better around
bends), make sure you get at least one light that can be
helmet-mounted. All of the ones I've mentioned except the VistaLite
400 can be mounted on a helmet. Sometimes if you buy a system, the
helmet mount comes with it. This can be a further advantage of buying
a system. </p>

<p> How many lighting heads do you need? Well, for on-road riding I'd
go for two: a high and low beam on the handlebars. The low beam is for
seeing where you're going when you're not going too fast, and the high
beam is for when you're going faster, or for when a car is coming and
you want to make sure you've been seen. I use 6W as my low beam and
10W as my high beam; some others prefer brighter lights (such as 10W
low, 20W high). For off-road riding I'd go for three lighting heads,
two on the bars as described above, and one on the helmet. I have a 5W
spot helmet light, and it's surprisingly effective. </p>

<h4>Batteries</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Your main choice is lead-acid or NiCad. Enthusiasts may want to
use NiMH batteries. I have a lighting system that uses NiMH batteries
(a <a href="http://home.clara.net/lumicycle/">Lumicycle</a>), but
there's nothing home made about it! The main difficulty with NiMH
batteries from a DIY perspective is getting a charger that works with
the batteries. For more info see my article on 
<a href="charger3.html">NiMH chargers</a>. </p>

<p> See the <a href="lights.html#bat-type">battery section</a>
of my <a href="lights.html">High-Powered
Bike Lights</a> article to decide whether lead-acid or NiCad is best
for you.  I feel that for general use with a 6V system, you should
have something like 5 amp-hours of power, or at least 4 amp-hours. A 5
amp-hour battery will power a 6W bulb for close to 5 hours. Of course
higher powered lights will give you shorter run time. While you may
not ever think that you will need this much capacity, it's good to
have it for emergencies. Since this battery will go on the bike, if
it's a NiCad battery, it should be in a water bottle style case so it
fits with less hassle. If you get a wide-mouth water bottle with a
screw cap, you can put the cells into the water bottle without cutting
it up. See <a href="bott-batt.html">here</a> for instructions. </p>

<p> If you use your lighting system in the same way I do mine, you'll
only turn on a helmet light when you're on twisty tracks, and you will
want your main light on the handlebar. Since you won't be burning as
much power with your helmet light, so you can get away with a smaller
battery. I'd recommend 2.5 to 2.8 amp-hours. Since you'll want this
battery to be on your body (say in a jersey pocket, water pack, or bum
bag), you'll want it to be flat. So a rectangular pack is best
here. </p>

<p> The best lead-acid batteries I know of are made by Hawker
Energy. See their 
<a href="http://www.hepi.com/vacvad.htm">list of distributers</a>.
NiCad cells are available from many electronics supply places, like
Radio Shack, Tandy, Farnell, Radio Spares, and Maplin. A very nice
place to get high-quality, reasonably-priced batteries in the US is 
<a href="http://nicdlady.com/">The NiCad Lady</a>. </p>

<h4>Cords</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> You need some cords with a barrel connector plug, with inner
diameter 2.5mm and outer diameter 5.5mm. Most bike lighting systems
come with "curley cords", curled springy cords that stretch to be
whatever length you need them to be. They are very convenient. However
the wires are often very thin and (uncurled) they are quite long, so
they can have significant resistance. You could end up burning up to
1W of power in your cord! If you know where you will be attaching your
battery and your lighting heads, you can make up custom, fixed-length
cords with thicker wire that has very little resistance. </p>

<p> You can easily get non-curley cords with these connectors in the
US, from an electronics store in Massachusetts, 
<a href="http://www.you-do-it.com/">"You-do-it" Electronics Center</a>.
A poster on the bikecurrent mailing list (sorry, I
forgot who!) wrote "They stock Philmore 5.5/2.5 mm right-angle plugs
molded onto 6-foot leads, part number TC250, for $1.99 each.  They are
of the proper barrel length and have been a real headache-solver for
me.  "You-do-it" publishes a catalog/buyer's guide (for $2.50), so you
should be able to mail-order from them." I have made all of my power
cords from these plugs, and they work perfectly. 
</p>

<p> I have not found a source for something similar in the UK. You can
get barrel connectors from Maplin, CPC, Radio Spares, and Farnell, but
you'll have to solder wires to them yourself. They are not nearly as
convenient nor as robust as the Philmore plugs. If you would like a few
of the Philmore plugs, I have some left over from my last order.

<h4>Putting the cord on the battery</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I've bought both VistaLite (430) and NiteRider (Pro-6) systems,
and they both came with batteries that were wired up with the positive
voltage in the middle of the barrel connector. So I wired up my
home-made batteries and chargers the same way. If you have barrel
connectors with attached cords, you need the multimeter to find out
which wire goes to which part of the connector.</p>

<p> There are a couple of options about connecting the cord to the
battery. One is whether or not to include a fuse in the cord. If for
some reason you get a short somewhere, you can drain and destroy your
battery pretty quickly, as well as creating alot of heat. If you put a
fuse in the battery (preferably in with the cells, even before it gets
to the cord part) it will burn out, protecting your battery and
yourself. </p>

<p> Another option is: if you're powering more than one lighting head
from your battery, do you bring one cord from the battery for each
lighting head, or have a cord that comes from the battery, then splits
near the lighting heads to provide several connectors on short cords?
VistaLite prefers the first approach, as they include two cords on
their multiheaded systems. This solution seems to be preferred by the
denizens of the bikecurrent mailing list for redundancy: if one cord
for some reason gets cut or breaks (but not in a way that it shorts
out), the other will continue to work, powering one of your lighting
heads. I find that it's neater to use the one-cord, two-connector
approach, so I do that and take the risk.

<h2>My Choices</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> My current setup for off-road night riding involves two lighting
heads on my handlebars, one light on my helmet, and two batteries.
The handlebar setup is a 5 amp-hour NiteRider NiCad water bottle
battery, a VistaLite 400 head with 6W unfrosted bulb, and VistaLite
500 head with 10W bulb. I adjust the beam of the VistaLite 400 until
it's pretty wide, and I point it to the ground in front of the
bike. The VistaLite 500 has a spot bulb. I aim it at the far end of
the pool of light created by the 400 head. It thus serves as a high
beam, to alert me to things coming from a reasonable distance
away. </p>

<p> I have removed the cord that came with the NiteRider battery and
replaced it with a non-curley cord that splits into two barrel
connectors to power the lights. </p>

<p> For a helmet light, I use a VistaLite 500 head powered by a 2.8
amp-hour battery made from 5 high-capacity C-sized NiCad cells. I have
a 5W spot bulb in the lighting head. Since I can point it exactly
where I want it, it's surprisingly useful despite not being
amazingly bright. Also, if I run out of power in my main battery, I
can use this one to power the handlebar light until I get home. I need
to make up a nylon case for it so I can attach it to the frame to do
this. The cord I use on this battery pack is the curley cord that was
cut off the NiteRider battery. It is useful to have a flexible cord
for this situation, since the distance from the battery to the light
changes somewhat as I move my head. </p>

<p> Note that my helmet light it pretty much equivalent to the
<a href="http://www.night-sun.com/htmldocs/sunsport.html">
NightSun SunSport</a>. This is partly intentional, as I knew about the
SunSport and its reputation as I was making mine. </p>

<p> This setup works great for me. I turn on only the 6W handlebar
light when we're on the road, getting to trails, or coming back from
the pub after a ride. When I hit dirt I'll turn on either the 10W
handlebar light, the 5W helmet light, or both. Since the off-road
rides I go on are usually about 1.5 hours, and my battery can power
the helmet light for maybe 2.5 hours, I tend not to spare the helmet
light. I turn it on for any reason, for example to give some light to
someone repairing a puncture. </p>

<p> Some people (but no one that I've ever ridden with!) use only
helmet mounted lights. But there is a problem with this: since the
light is very near your eyes, you don't see shadows, so you get much
less depth perception. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Redundancy</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I don't carry spare bulbs, except for the VistaLite 400. It takes very
small bulbs and has a large body, with loads of nooks and crannies for
hiding spares. Thus it's silly not to carry one. </p>

<p> I don't carry spares for the VistaLite 500 lights on my handlebar
or the helmet. In fact, if the bulb on the VistaLite 400 blew on a
night ride I'd probably just continue the ride and fix it when I'm
back home. Since I have 3 lighting heads in total, I figure I'll have
enough lights anyway. </p>

<p> Also note that I have two batteries which have the same kinds of
plugs on them, so I can use them interchangeably. Actually the main
use of this will be if I stay out too long, burning down my main
battery, and then I can use the helmet light battery to power a
handlebar light.</p>
