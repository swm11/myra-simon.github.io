<H1>Myra's Tour of Oregon (June/July 1990)</H1>

<blockquote>

<p> Day one: Landed in Portland, assambled my bike, and headed west. Got
about 45 miles (to Gales Creek) before excessive tiredness sat in. I
spent the night in the Balm Grove Tavern and Park. A park (at least
the private ones) in Oregon is a place for you to park your RV at
overnight. I convinced the bartender to give me a beer when I paid for
my night's stay, and I played a game of pool with one of the locals
before setting up camp.</p>

<p> Day two: Headed out west. Went over the coastal range, then got to the
coast (Tillamook) by lunch. Then headed south. Missed the entrance to
the campsite I was planning on staying at, so went to next one.
Dragged in late to a state park in Lincoln City, having gone 99.5
miles that day. Began to feel cramped by not being able to sit up
conveniently in my tent and began to wish for a new one. The state
park had a biker/hiker area, an area with a few picnic tables and a
fire pit where bike tourists and backpackers stay and pay only $2 a
night. I addition, there were flush toilets and solar heated showers.
There was one backpacker and four other bikers there besides myself.
One of them, Tim, was particularly nice.</p>

<p> Day three: Headed south along the coast. Started off really slowly,
had only gone about 35 miles by 3pm. Picked up, however, and did 45
miles before I pulled into my campsite (Honeyman State Park, just
south of Florence) for the night. It was a real sunny day, and the
coast was very pretty. There was another hiker/biker area at this
campground, and again 4 other bikers, one of whom was Tim.</p>

<p> Day four: After wandering around the dunes for awhile, I headed south.
When I got to Reedsport I headed east along route 38.  At Elkton,
where 138 splits off from 38 (about 60 miles from where I started), I
went off a very steep shoulder and ditched the bike. I tumbled over a
few times, heard a KLUNK as my helmet hit the road, and scraped up my
elbow, but I was OK. The same could not be said of the bike. The front
rim was horribly bent and the bike seemed to want to turn right all
the time. I pushed it to a gas station to ask if there was a bike shop
in town. There wasn't, but a mechanic tried to straigten the wheel,
without success. They suggested that I try to hitchhike into Roseburg,
the nearest town with a bike shop. So I walked to the intersection of
138 and tried thumbing it. About the fourth truck by picked my up.
This fellow said he'd take me as far as his ranch, 8 miles down the
road. As we were driving, he noted that by the time I could get to
Roseburg, the bike shop would be closed, and why didn't I set up my
tent at his ranch for the night, and he'd get me a ride in the next
day. Myra immediately became suspicious. But I went to his place and met
his entire family, and I knew I was perfectly safe. I was invited to eat
dinner, take a shower, and wash my clothes.  What nice folks!</p>

<p> Day five: Got a ride into Roseburg with an Oregon forest service
employee who was out passing around orders for Douglas Fir seedlings.
On the way in he stopped to show me a herd of elk, an osprey nest, and
a fish ladder (a way for migrating fish to go upstream around dams).
At Roseburg I got a new wheel. As I was riding out, I noticed that the
bike still wanted to turn to the right alot. I took it back and they
said the fork needed to be straightened. While they were straigtening
my fork, I got a ride from the shop owner to the local sporting good
store to look at tents and kill time. I really had no intention of
buying a tent when I walked in there, but they had a really nice tent
at a good price (and Oregon has no sales tax) so I bought it and
mailed the old one back. Finally, my bike was fixed, so I headed east
along 138, which goes along the incredibly beautiful North Umpqua
River. I pulled into Eagle Rock campsite, about 50 miles from
Roseburg, where a guy and his two daughters invited me to park my
sleeping bag in their tent for the night. So I ate dinner with them
and slept in their tent.</p>

<p> Day six: Got a ride with the people I'd spent the night with into
Crater Lake. I'd heard that from about Eagle Rock on it was a straight
climb up to it, so I wanted to avoid that climb. They left me at a
campground south (and considerably below invertical distance) of the
crater, where I set up my tent and left my bags. Since I'd never set
up the tent before I wanted to make sure I did it in the daylight. It
didn't look like rain so I didn't worry about the fly. Then I went off
to bike around Rim Drive, a 42 mile (when you include the distance to
and from the campground) ride around the rim of the crater.  It was
cool while I was up there, cool enough to wear a light jacket while
biking. I learned later that two days after I left it snowed there.</p>

 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" hspace="10">

<p> Day seven: Headed south out of Crater Lake (didn't want to go back up
to the top of the crater again carrying all my gear), and it was all
downhill. Then went north along highway 97, the sraightest, flattest
road I've ever seen. It goes through a desert (Oregon's High Desert,
semiarid land covered with sagebrush, dust, scraggly pines, and
occasional clumps of grass). Ran into a road crew that was laying new
pavement and got a ride through the work area (they didn't want to get
my tires all covered with tar). Camped in the a place (88 miles from
where I started) that was basically a few flat spots in the woods. I
had asked a local in La Pine where the nearest campgrounds were, and
she mentioned this one, not mentioning that there were no facilities
(like toilets or a source of water) there, and that there were no
signs leading to it. I found it only by going exactly where she said
it would be. There was no one else there, and I felt sort of lonely
and scared. It didn't look like rain, so again I didn't get out the
fly.</p>

<p> Day eight: While waiting for the dew to dry from the tent so I could
pack it away I attached all the ropes and tighteners to the fly and
read the instructions on how to attach it. Continued north and did
some sightseeing along with my biking. Went in Lava River Cave, a lava
tube that is long (about a mile of it has been dug out), dark (they
rent you propane lanterns so you can see, flashlights are just not
bright enough), and cold (I was wearing a jacket, and my hands got very
cold). Also went up to the top of Lava Butte (courtesy of a nice
family with a car), which is a very tall cone with a small crater at
the top and gives a nice view of the surrounding territory. Camped in
Tumalo State Park, about 4 miles north of Bend, and had my first
shower in 4 days. Met a real nice family who lived in Corbett, Oregon,
along the Columbia River. Didn't look like rain, so I didn't put on
the fly.</p>

 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" hspace="10">

<p> Day nine: At 6am I awoke to the sound of raindrops hitting my tent, a
very unexpected (but very welcome to the locals) event in that part of
the state. I got out and put on the fly, very glad that I had
assembled it the previous morning. I went back to sleep. When I woke
up I asked around about weather reports, and was told it would clear
up in the afternoon. I decieded to wait it out. I got a ride with the
nice family to the High Desert Museum, about 6 miles south of Bend, as
they were on their way into town for breakfast. Wandered aound the
museum for a few hours, then got a ride as far as Bend with a couple
of nice ladies in a Mercedes that smalled strongly of leather and had
only one windshield whiper that would lengthen itself when it went
past the corners of the windshield, and from Bend to the campground
with a white-bearded guy in a small pickup that had junk all over the
floor and a large black dog that kept crawling all over me. The tent
was dry, so I packed up and left, heading north on 97. It was 3:40 by
the time I hit the road, and I had terrible headwinds, so after only
about 33 miles I called it quits and parked myself in a KOA
campground, which cost $10/night!  Well, at least I got a shower and
got to do my laundry.</p>

<p> Day ten: Continued north on 97. Went through some grasslands, lots of
fields (some growing peppermint, what a wonderful smell), then back to
the high desert. Out of Madras turned onto 26 north and went through a
large Indian reservation, where the only Indians I saw were in stores
on the way in. It was cool, which was good, since I found no sources
of driking water (I mean stores or rest ares with drinking fountains,
not streams) until I reached the campground where I slept for the
night. Out of the reservation, the land seemed to suddenly turn from
desert into forest.  I camped at Frog Lake campground, about 7 miles
from Mount Hood, the highest point in Oregon, and about 67 miles from
the KOA.</p>

<p> Day eleven: Headed north along 26, then north along 35. The first part
was up and down hill until I got past Mount Hood, then the road
followed the Hood River into the city of Hood River. There I crossed
the Columbia River into Washington State to avoid highway 84, which is
a superhighway, then headed west along route 14. Camped in Beacon Rock
State Park, where I had to pay $.25 for a shower (showers in Oregon
parks, if they had them, were free), which was about 81 miles from
Frog Lake. This was the 4th of July, but the nearest fireworks were 10
miles away, and I knew of no way to get to them, so I saw no fireworks
(BOO!).</p>

 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" hspace="10">

<p> Day twelve: I walked to the top of Beacon Rock, a very large rock that
sits next to the Columbia River and provides a nice view of the gorge.
Then I backtracked a little, heading east about 10 miles to get to the
Bridge of the Gods to get back over into Oregon. Then I headed west
again. I had to ride along superhighway 84 about 15 miles to get to
route 30, the Columbia Scenic Highway. Just getting off 84, I had my
first flat of the trip, on my back tire. I dug through my panniers for
a spare tube and replaced it. On hwy 30 there are lots of waterfalls,
at least 5 of them just off the road and more a short hike away. At
the second one, Multnomah Falls, it started to rain, so I had lunch at
the Multnomah Lodge (which I had been told, by the family from
Corbett, had good food at reasonable prices) in an attempt to wait out
the rain.  I had a very nice, enjoyable lunch for about $5.25, tip
included, but the rain had not gone away by the time I was finished.
On the way out I found another biker, a short, chubby female with a
nice touring bike, who was parked under an overhang, also hoping to
wait out the rain. She was heading the same way I was (west) so we
agreed to bike together as far as Corbett, where I wanted to call the
nice family I had met and see if I could visit them. So we biked
together, stopping at all the falls, getting thoroughly wet (it was
still raining). We took some pictures of each other and the scenery
and had a nice chat as we were biking. Despite me being fully loaded
and her carrying basically nothing, I was able to keep up with her
with no problem. At Corbett I called the family, who invited me to
come on up, and as I was on my way there, the husband (who was on his
way home) stopped to give me a lift. I dried off and had a nice dinner
with them and felt very much at home. With all my sightseeing, I only
did 36 miles, but I had very little distance to go and lots of time so
it didn't bother me.</p>

<p> Day thirteen: I did the family's dishes in the morning (it was the
least I could do) and headed off west towards Portland (I was only
about 30 miles away). The rain had stopped, but my plan was to go to a
park that I'd seen on my Portland map, find a shelter (in case it
started to rain again), and sit there and relax and read while waiting
for the youth hostel to open at 5. About halfway to Portland I got
another flat. I didn't feel like digging through my panniers for the
second spare tube, so I patched and replaced the one that was there. I
was very near the park when it started to rain.  Unfortunately, I
couldn't find the entrance to it, so I got totally drenched as I rode
around looking for it. Finally I got directions, went to the park, and
found a shelter. The rain had just about stopped by now, but I was
cold and wet. I took off my cold, drenched T-shirt and put on my warm,
dry, fuzzy jacket, and waited for the hostel to open. At 5 I packed up
and headed for the youth hostel. I picked a bed in the co-ed section
on the "sleeping porch", a fence-and-plastic-sheeting enclosed porch
where I could sleep next to my bike. I took a shower and then asked
the person at the desk what there was to do in Portland. Turns out
she's a fan of the same sorts of movies I am, and she know the
location and times for a theater showing JESUS DE MONTREAL, a film I'd
heard about and wanted to see. I zipped to the theater on my bike, and
the nice ticket seller let me park my bike inside (I only had a cable
lock with me). The movie was really good.  This satisfied one of my
cravings (things I had gone without for 2 weeks and really desired).
On my way back to the youth hostel, I happened on the Rose City Blues
Festival, which I would have gone into (only $2), except that it was
almost over for the night. Oh, well. So I headed back to the hostel,
hoping to satify another craving, that of beer. There I met Jill, a
Californian who was doing a Seattle-to-San Diego bike ride and was
waiting in Portland to meet her brother, who would accompany her the
rest of the way. I told her about my exploits. She loves beer, but was
on medication, so couldn't go out with me. I asked a geeky-looking
German guy, but he had to get up early the next day. I came upon a
bunch of people and asked them if they were interested, and it turns
out that they had just come back from getting beer. Oh, well. So I
settled for talking to them instead.  Ended up talking mostly with
this English fellow who had spent the entire day at the Blues
Festival, and had recorded it on his Walkman.</p>

<p> Day fourteen: got up, ate breakfast, and headed downtown with Jill to
kill time. We happened on the "Portland Saturday Market (Sundays
too!)", where we wandered around the booths and looked at all the
pretty crafts, and then I had to go. I went to the airport, put my
bike in a box and strapped my panniers together, then flew back to
Philadelphia.</p>

<p> Note: all photos taken with my Olympus XA, which looks like a
modern point-and-shoot camera, but is actually a manual focus
rangefinder and an aperture-priority automatic.  For durability,
portability, and sharp photos, they are hard to beat. They were only
made in the late '70s to mid '80s but have a good reputation among
photographers. Every now and then I'm tempted to buy a
point-and-shoot, but then I get back another role of film and decide
to stick with the XA. </p>
