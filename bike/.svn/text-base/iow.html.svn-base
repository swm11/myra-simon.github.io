<h1>She's got a ticket to Ryde</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> I'm an active member of the Cambridge Cycling Campaign. Clare
Macrae, the coordinator, mentioned that there was going to be a
cycling campaigners' conference (organized by <a
href="http://www.cyclewight.org.uk/cw.htm">CycleWight</a>) May 5 in
Ryde (the biggest city on the Isle of Wight), and that the following
day the <a href="http://www.cycleisland.co.uk/">Isle of Wight
Randonee</a> would be held. I thought, why not? I've never been to the
Isle of Wight and I hear it's nice. So I signed up and bought my train
ticket, which I amusingly noted was a ticket to Ryde.  </p>

<P> The journey to the Isle of Wight (for a map of most
of the Isle of Wight, see <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?grid2map?x=455000&y=85000&zoom=5&isp=250&ism=10000">here</a>)
was fairly involved:
train from Cambridge to Kings Cross station in London, Tube (aka
London Underground) to Walterloo Station, still in London, then train
to Portsmouth Harbour, then ferry to Ryde Pier, then train from the
pier to the main bit of the island. Now you can't take bikes on the
Tube during rush hour, and I'd be getting to London smack dab in the
middle of rush hour, 5pm on a Friday. I would have to cycle from Kings
Cross to Waterloo. Also I was told that most cyclists avoid the 
train from Ryde Pier to Ryde by riding on the little bridge beside the
train tracks. </p>

<p> The bike I chose for the trip is in fact not my bike: it's my
boyfriend Simon's bike, a <a
href="http://www.pashley.co.uk/landrover/apb.htm"> Moulton Land
Rover</a>. I wanted a bike that's good to ride and has lots of gears
for the Randonee on Sunday, but wanted it to be easily transportable
for the train journeys. I've often found that a normal bike fits
awkwardly into spaces on trains, and I thought that because of its
smaller wheels the Moulton would be shorter and would fit better. And
if I needed to fit it in even smaller spaces (say a luggage rack) I
could take it apart. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Friday</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I met Clare at the train station and we took the train to Kings
Cross. Clare headed for the Tube and I hopped on my bike after one
final look at the London A-Z to try to memorize my route. Despite my
trepidations, the trip was fast and easy! It seems that my years of
cycling in Philadelphia and Cambridge have prepared me well for
cycling in heavy London traffic. I arrived at Waterloo well before
Clare, and watched one train head out to Portsmouth Harbour. Then
Clare arrived and we got the next train. This was a bit of a
nightmare. There were quite a few cyclists trying to get on the train,
but the first luggage space we came to was locked. We had to go almost
to the other end of the train (and it was a long train!) to find a
place to put our bikes. Meanwhile, Clare had saved a seat for me back
at the other end of the train, so I fought my way through all the cars
to get to her. The trip to Portsmouth Harbour was uneventful, and we
caught the Ferry to Ryde without a problem. Clare hopped on the little
train to get into town, while I rode along the bridge. </p>

<p> A CycleWight member was going to be putting me up for the weekend,
so I phoned her to tell her I was in town. No answer. Hmmmm. So I
headed to the Vine pub in St. Helens, a little village a few miles
from Ryde, where the conference attendees would be hanging out. I
walked around the pub looking for Clare, whom I thought would have
arrived by then, as she was coming by taxi, but didn't see anyone
familiar. The bar lady asked if I was looking for the cycling people
(I was swinging a bike helmet and was obviously looking for someone,
so this was a good guess) and was pointed to the restaurant bit in the
back.</p>

<p> I still didn't see Clare, but I introduced myself to a couple
people, got a beer, and ordered dinner (tuna baguette). Soon Clare
showed up and we chatted to the others. Eventually I headed off,
confident that the lady who was putting me up must have gotten home by
now. I found the house without too much difficulty (thanks to good
mapreading and a bit of luck) and soon felt at home. My hostess, Ann,
was easy to get along with, and was quite interested in bikes. Her
husband is even more so, and she showed me his mountain bikes. He even
had one (an old rigid Kona Explosif) in the attic room where I slept
to keep me company.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Saturday</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> By the time I'd gotten out of bed and had a shower, Ann had
already set out for a walk with her dogs, so I was on my own for
breakfast. </p>

<p> The day was bright and sunny, and the conference didn't start
until 10:30, so I had a look around before going to Ryde High School
where the talks were being held. The most interesting thing I saw were
a couple guys with big kites and surfboards setting up their gear on
the beach. When they finally got going, they were zipping back and
forth over the water, pulled by the kites. Pretty cool.</p>

<p> The cycle parking for the conference was in an enclosed
courtyard. There were quite a variety of bikes, including a brace of
Bromptons in the corner. There was one Moulton besides mine, and a
bunch of hybrids, touring bikes, and mountain bikes. </p>

<p> The talks during the day were interesting, and it struck me how
many of the problems we're having in Cambridge are problems faced by
campaigners all over the country. These problems include the
popularity of buildouts and central islands as traffic calming (which
form pinch points and make life more difficult for cyclists in the
presence of impatient drivers who want to be able to overtake at all
times), and the closure of city center roads to cyclists when they are
pedestrianised. Of course there were a range of views on things (Don
Mathew, policy advisor to the CTC, advocated reallocating roadspace to
give more of it to cycles; but <a
href="http://www.lesberries.co.uk/cycling/cycling.htm">John Franklin</a>
noted that often there isn't enough space on British roads for general
vehicle lanes along with good quality bike facilities, so the drive
for reallocation can result in poor quality cycle provision) but I got
a good idea of what people were thinking and what the issues were.</p>

<p> One of the things I thought about again were the conflicts between
the needs and desires of trained cyclists and the desires of new
cyclists. As a competent road cyclist, all I want are safe roads. In
other words, I don't want councils to put in pedestrian buildouts and
central islands as traffic calming, and I don't like left-turn-only
lanes or other schemes that put bikes in conflict with cars. But many
new cyclists prefer off-road paths, which basically go along the
pavement (sidewalk). I hate these. If I used these I'd have to slow
way down to have any hope of avoiding uppredictable pedestrains, dogs,
and wobbly cyclists. Also, I'd have to give way to traffic coming from
all directions at every single junction and drive, which makes the
journey even more slow and more hazardous. In fact, <a
href="http://www.lesberries.co.uk/cycling/cy_pathr.htm">study after
study</a> has shown that these sorts of cycle paths lead to more
accidents than simply riding on the road. Despite this, many new
cyclists insist that they are safer. When I try to explain to them why
they are not safer, they disagree vehemently, seeming to think that
their powers of observation are so keen that they can avoid all the
hazards from pedestrians, dogs, lamp posts, and cars (at junction and
drives) and be safer on the paths. I find it frustrating to no end,
and yet many of these facilities are backed up by cycle campaigners,
who say that the fact that some people feel safer (even if they aren't
safer) when using them is a big win. </p>

<p> The talks were over at 5pm, and Clare headed back to Cambridge, as
she wasn't doing the Randonee. Dinner was at another pub (the Wishing
Well just outside Nettlestone), but wasn't until 7:30, so I
entertained myself by exploring the town and the beach area. Then I
headed off to the pub, and sat with the guys I'd sat with the previous
evening. I noticed that a local brewery, <a
href="http://www.goddards-brewery.co.uk/beers.htm">Goddards</a>, had
quite a few different beers on the taps. I chose one called
"Fuggle-Dee-Dum" which has "spreading a little hoppiness" on the sign
on the pump. Sounded good, so I got a pint. And it was very good
indeed. As time goes by I'm developing a real taste for the different
sorts of English beers, and this one had a strong, real beer taste. If
I hadn't been about to go on a long bike ride the next day, I would
have sampled more of them. With my beer I had some scampi and chips,
which was pretty good. At about 10pm I headed off to Ann's place to
sleep. Before this I'd made arrangements with the guys at my table to
meet at one of the checkpoints to ride the randonee together. </p>

<h4>Sunday</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I slept well in my attic room and woke up full of
energy. Unfortunately, it was cloudy, but that had some advantages
too: it wouldn't get too hot, and I wouldn't get a sunburn. After
breakfast I packed everything up and cycled over to the house of
Malcolm, one of the organizers of the conference, to drop off my
backpack. I didn't want to take it with me on the ride, and as his
house is very near the checkpoint I'd be starting the ride at, he'd
volunteered to look after it for me.</p>

<p> I went to the Havenstreet checkpoint and met up with the other
guys. I asked them thier names, which I hadn't gotten around to doing
the previous evening despite spending a couple of hours sitting at
their table! There was Jim riding a hybrid, Dougal on a rigid mountain
bike with fat slick tires and mudguards, Richard on a 3-speed
Brompton, and me on Simon's Moulton. </p>

<p> We headed out together. Richard was having difficulties with the
hills: his bike lacked low gears, so he'd have to charge up the hills
to have any chance of getting to the top on the bike. Sometimes, for
the longer hills, he'd have to stop and walk up. Still, he managed to
catch up with us soon after the hill. He must be really fit! </p>

<p> We went through the East Cowes checkpoint, then crossed the River
Medina on the floating bridge. This is a flat boat pulled across the
river by chains. There were loads of cyclists waiting when we got
there, so there was far more area taken up by bikes than cars on the
trip over. Soon after we got on the other side, we found ourselves at
a T-junction. The Round-the-Island cycle route sign pointed left up a
steep hill, but there was a sign across the road saying road closed.
All the cyclists were going right, which lead to a flat road along the
seafront. Jim and Dougal blithely headed up the hill, while Richard,
wanting to avoid big hills on the Brompton, headed along the
seafront. I didn't feel like going up unnecessary hills, so I stuck
with Richard. We rode along the seafront, then rejoined the cycle
route, having no idea whether the others were in front or behind
us.</p>

<p> The randonee works like this: there are seven checkpoints along
the route. All of them are open 9am to 6pm, and you're supposed to go
around them in the counter-clockwise direction (generally keeping the
sea to your right). At the beginning of your ride you sign up at any
of the checkpoints (this is free) and get a check card. You get your
card stamped at each checkpoint as you go around. When you get back to
your start checkpoint you are issued a certificate and get the
opportunity to buy an enamal badge. At two of the checkpoints,
Bembridge (the easternmost checkpoint) and Yarmouth (the westernmost),
they have food you can buy (sandwiches, soup, chocolate bars, cakes,
tea) and there are various stores and tea shops along the route to get
additional food. </p>

<p> Yarmouth was about 20 miles from where we started, but I was
getting hungry with still about 5 miles to go. I mentioned this, and
Richard suggested we stop for a snack. I said I could probably wait
until the checkpoint, but then I began to realize that he was wanting
a break and saw this as a good excuse for one. So we pulled up onto a
grassy area and I got out my one and only cereal bar (bad planning on
my part, I usually bring much more food on rides than this) and
started eating. I had almost finished when Dougal and Jim rolled
up. We were reunited! I packed away the wrapper and we were on our
way. </p>

<p> Finally reaching Yarmouth we got our cards stamped and settled
down to a light meal. I had a tuna sandwich, cup of soup, roll, tea,
and a couple of pieces of cake. I also bought some chocolate bars
(Mars and Kit Kat) to make sure I'd have food with me in case I got
hungry before Bembridge, which was a long distance away. </p>

<p> After Yarmouth Richard was having an even harder time keeping up,
the earlier hills having worn him out. He dropped back. Eventually
Dougal, noticing he was missing, dropped back to stay with him. I
stayed with Jim, who was chatting to a guy who turned out to be Peter
Davenport, one of the speakers from the previous day. </p>

<p> We went through the Brook checkpoint and were now on the south
coast of the island. After awhile the group noticed that we were going
in the wrong direction. I didn't think we'd missed any signs, but they
felt sure we were going back the way we'd come. So we took a left
turn, heading for the sea. When we reached a T-junction we turned
left, keeping the sea on our right.  Eventually we passed some cycle
route signs, so we were now back on track. Talking to people later, it
seemed that there was someone along the road pointing out an unsigned
turn, and we had not noticed. </p>

<p> I noticed that my front brake was acting up: it was rubbing
against the rim. I wasn't sure why it was, but I felt I should adjust
it. So we stopped and I got out my Allen keys and loosened the brake
cable. Just as I was putting my tools away, Richard and Dougal came
by. Together again. Briefly. </p>

<p> Jim took off, figuring that we'd soon follow, but Richard was
having troubles with his back tire. Evidently Brompton wheels are a
nightmare to remove and replace, so a soft rear tire spelled
trouble. He borrowed my pump (Zefal HP-X) to inflate it, but in less
than a minute it was soft again. Luckily Peter's car was nearby, and
Peter was planning on packing it in because his front tire had gone
soft as well. So Peter offered Richard a lift, and Dougal and I went
on our way. </p>

<p> Not long after that we passed a sign for home made ice cream.
Mmmmm, ice cream... We went to the farm shop to get some and ate it
while chatting to the lady in the shop. Then back on our way.  Coming
to the top of a long hill we saw Jim waiting for us, and I immediately
felt guilty. I should have known he'd wait for us; we shouldn't have
stopped for the ice cream. Oh, well... </p>

<p> We were now at the southern tip of the island, and we proceeded
on. Jim got a puncture in his rear tire which he fixed efficiently
(his bike having plain derailleur gears), and we continued on through
the Whitwell checkpoint without incident. But then I started feeling
very hungry. I vowed that at the Alverstone checkpoint I'd indulge in
some chocolate. I thought I'd eat half my Mars bar. I really don't
like Mars bars; I'd bought it just to make sure I had some calories
with me. At the Alverstone checkpoint I unwrapped the Mars bar as I
stood in the queue for the loo. By the time it was my turn, it had
disappeared. I must have really needed the food. The sun started to
shine for the first time that day as we set out again. Five miles
later we were in Bembridge. Because of all the delays (punctures,
getting separated, etc) it was nearly 5pm, and we still had 8 miles to
go. But we needed food, and we thought it prudent to take some time at
the checkpoint to eat. So we steadily ate our way through more
sandwiches, soup, rolls, and cakes, and it was about 5:10 when we set
out again. </p>

<p> Jim took the lead. Ever since we got back together Dougal and I
had let him lead. He was setting a good, steady pace, so we just
followed him, not close enough to draft, but keeping a fixed distance
between us. I was very conscious of time, and having eaten and rested
was full of energy. I had to hold back to stay behind Jim. It is a
good thing I did, because I'm sure if I had gone off at the pace I
felt like keeping, I'd have burnt out pretty quickly. We chugged on,
passing riders left and right. As it was very close to the deadline,
most of the poeple still out on the road were dead tired and had
little to no energy left. We on the other hand had not been working as
hard as we could have and had some energy to spare. As we got closer
and closer to Havenstreet Jim slowly picked up the pace. I dropped off
a bit, Dougal dropped back even further. I held back a bit so Dougal
wouldn't lose touch with us completely. Jim was out of sight up the
last rise, and Dougal and I slowly chugged up. Finally, we were
there. I looked at my watch. 5:53, 7 minutes before closing time! We'd
made it, but not by much... We congratulated ourselves, took pictures,
chatted a bit, then headed out. </p>

<p> I returned to Malcolm's place and picked up my bag, then
proceeded to the pier, resenting the heavy pack on my back and
thinking about what I could leave behind for next time. I met Jim at
the ferry terminal, then remembered that he lived in Stevenage, which
is between London and Cambridge, so I realized that we'd be going most
of the way back together. We took the ferry, then sat with a couple of
other conference delegates on the train ride from Portsmouth to
Waterloo. Going from Waterloo to Kings Cross stations in London I
followed Jim, which was much easier than plotting my own route. We
checked the arrivals and departures board in Kings Cross and
discovered that there was a Cambridge Cruiser train (one that goes
directly from London to Cambridge with no stops in between) leaving in
about 4 minutes. I ran to the platform, tossed the bike on the train,
then settled down for a pleasant (except for the incessant ringing of
mobile phones) ride back to Cambridge.  </p>
