<p> I had my first baby (Ellen) in March 2003, and my second (Luke) in
2006. In this article I describe how we set up our bike trailers for
use with Ellen, and later, Luke and Ellen. Most of the article is
about cycling with just Ellen in the trailer, but I've added a bit at
the end about adding Luke. (See <b>Two kids in a trailer</b> below.) </p>

<p> After I had Ellen, I didn't start riding my bike again immediately
after she was born. There are two main reasons for that. The first is
that I had her by Cesarean, which meant that for the first few weeks I
was recovering from abdominal surgery. The second is that I had a
newborn baby to look after, so I couldn't ride until I felt she was
big enough to come with me, at least to tolerate short journeys on
smooth roads. As she neared two months old I began to feel that she
was getting to be robust enough, so we worked on setting up the
trailer (which we'd bought for her before she was born) for use with a
baby. </p>

<p> The trailer we got was a Burley Solo. We decided to get a single
child trailer, despite the fact that we want to have two kids
eventually, because the bike facilities around here are in some ways
very inadequate. The people who designed them seemed to assume that
everyone rides a plain unencumbered bike, so anyone who has a bike
that's a bit wider than normal (via having a front basket or towing a
trailer) often finds herself having to get off the bike to try to try
to lift or maneuver the bike through the barriers (such as bollards
with a narrow spacing) put in the way. (Even when I was a person
riding a plain bike, I still found plenty of problems with cycle
facilities, but that's <a href="bike-saf.html#facilities">another
story</a>.) Thus I wanted a trailer that was narrow enough to
get through these barriers, so we got a single trailer. When we have
#2, we'll probably have to get a 2-child trailer and either take
different routes or get off and guide the trailer through the
barriers by lifting or moving the trailer sideways. <br clear=all>

<p> We had to do two things to get the trailer ready for transporting
Ellen. The first is that the wheels weren't round. The tires didn't
fit on the rim properly, so there was more than a 1cm difference
between the radius to the outer edge of the tires over the
circumference of the wheels. We fixed that by going back to the guy
who sold us the trailer and getting him to swap the wheels over. </p>

<p> The other thing we needed to do was to figure out how to fit a car
safety seat in the trailer. We have a Britax Rock-a-Tot car seat, and
it has the interesting feature that the lap belt can go either in the
usual place over the lap of the child, or it can go into slots
underneath the child seat. This latter routing makes it much easier to
get the baby in and out of the seat. </p>

<p> The trailer has a fabric kiddie seat already in it, with a padded
bottom part and a mesh back part. We decided that the car seat
wouldn't fit in the trailer with the back part in place. Since it was
held in place simply by being looped over a bar at the top of the
trailer, we took it off the bar and let the back part fall to the
floor of the trailer for use later. We put the carry handle of the car
seat in the position it would go in when in a car (sticking out behind
the seat) and put in two sets of nylon webbing straps, one through the
slots under the front part of the car seat and around the frame at the
bottom of the trailer, and one through the slots at the back of the
car seat and around the trailer frame. The diagram gives you an idea
of how we put the straps on the seat, except that we used two separate
sets of webbing anchoring the seat to the trailer frame instead of one
car seat belt. <br clear=all>

<p> And then we were ready to roll. This was just before Ellen was two
months old. The first trip we did in the trailer was a little trip
down to the meeting place of the local CTC rides, and we showed her
off to our cycling friends as they gathered for a ride. Simon pulled
her, as I still wasn't very strong yet. However soon the trailer was
attached to my bike and I began taking her around. Since she would
usually fall asleep in the trailer, I could go for short rides (up to
about 15 miles) without any problems, but I usually did shorter rides,
of about 7 miles or less. Usually we had a destination in mind, like a
supermarket or farm shop, where we could combine picking up something
useful while getting some exercise. </p>

<p> Over the summer I continued these short trips, often putting Ellen
in the trailer for a short jaunt after work (when Ellen was 3 months
old I started working part time). I didn't go on any trips longer than
about 15 miles, except for a little <a href="bse.html">bike tour to
Bury St. Edmunds</a> we did when Ellen was 5 months old. We rode 32
miles to get there and 40 miles back, and these are the longest rides
I have done with her. </p>

<p> Initially we used the head support that came with the seat, but
after a few month she'd grown enough that it was squishing her ears,
so we took it out. By that time she'd grown more robust and could hold
her head in place better anyway, and so didn't need it. When we
started riding I would ride very slowly with her over smooth surfaces
only, but starting when she was about 6 months old I started to
occasionally take her on very mild offroad bits. We live close to the River
Cam, which has a somewhat bumpy towpath alongside it. I ride along
that, fairly slowly, and Ellen doesn't seem to mind. She doesn't sleep
in the trailer when we're on the towpath, but otherwise she acts just
the same as any other time I tow her (sitting quietly in the seat and
watching the scenery go by). </p>

<p> <b>Update 1:</b> Now it is November, and Ellen is 8 months old. I
still tow her along in the trailer, but it's not so easy any
more. It's gotten cool, so whenever we go out I have to take the time
to dress both her and myself in warm clothing. Luckily, with her in
the trailer I don't have to worry about her getting wet; the plastic
rain cover keeps her completely dry and helps keep her warm as well by
keeping the wind off her. It also gets dark quite early as well. I
have good lights on my bike: a dynamo powered front light plus a white
LED front light, a good LED rear light, and I've put two LED rear
lights on the back of the trailer in place of the provided
reflectors. I've also put some more reflective tape on the back of the
trailer. I also wear a neon yellow jacket with lots of reflective
stipes when I ride to further improve my visibility. I think I'm about
as safe as one can be cycling on the roads at night, and a great deal
safer then the idiots I see riding in dark clothes with no lights!</p>

<p> <b>Update 2:</b> When Ellen was 11 months old she was getting too
big to go into the car seat, so we took it out and just used the
seat provided with the trailer. And we kept going like that for a
few years. </p>

<p> A couple of years after Ellen was born we moved house, and the
cycle routes near our new house didn't have the stupid narrow gaps
that we had to endure with our old house. So now getting a 2-child
trailer would be sensible. In Nov 2005 I became pregnant with our
second child. In April 2006, when I was 5 months pregnant, we got a
new 2-child trailer.  We got it then rather than waiting a few more
months because our next-door neighbors, who are enthusiastic cycle
commuters, were due to have a baby in April. They had talked about
getting a new trailer, but we told them that they could borrow our
single-child trailer for as long as they liked, since we were planning
on getting a 2-child trailer anyway. (Amusingly, they had read my
article about cycling with a baby on the web earlier, and then they
found the author of the article moving in next door!) </p>

<p> We knew that we wouldn't be able to use our previous solution, the
car seat, for the new baby, as there wasn't enough room in the trailer
for the car seat plus our daughter. The new solution was the Weber
child seat. This is a very lightweight piece of polystyrene foam
molded into a seat shape, with a fake fleece cover. There are areas on
the back and bottom of the seat to thread through two nylon straps
(provided), and you put these straps around the trailer frame to
secure the seat.  </p>

<p> In August 2006 we had our new baby, Luke, this time via a normal
birth. I recovered more quickly this time, but we still waited until
Luke was about 2 months old before starting to take him out in the
trailer. We had ordered the baby head support to go with the Weber
seat and used that initially, but removed it when he didn't need
it. Again, at around 11 months, we took out the baby seat and the kids
just rode using the seat provided in the trailer, as shown in the photo. </p>

<p> As I write this, it is now June 2008, and it's getting to be a bit
of a squeeze in the trailer, with Ellen a bit over 5 years old and
Luke coming up to 2 years old. It will probably be OK for them over
the summer, but come autumn, when they go back into their layers of
sweaters and jackets, they will no longer fit into the trailer. The
next step is getting a childback tandem for me and Ellen to ride,
while we pull Luke in the trailer behind. That will be my cycling
project for the summer: to sort that out. Stay tuned...</p>
