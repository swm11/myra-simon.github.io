<h1> Hot Hilly Humid Humiliating Hundred </h1>

<p> Here's my report on the "Quad Quashing 108" that Joe (I never did
learn his last name) of the Outdoor Club of South Jersey lead on
Saturday. </p>

<p> Pete Laverghetta and I were the only people to show up to this
ride, besides Joe! Linda and Terry were planning on coming, but for
some reason they didn't show up. I thought that it was strange that
the only people showing up to an Outdoor Club ride were BCPers...
Anyway, Joe passed out cue sheets (5 pages long!), gave hints, and we
headed out. The cue sheet was labelled "The Hilly Humid Hundred", but
as we rode along, we thought of a few more H words we could throw
in. </p>

<p> Hill rating: this is really not such a hilly ride. The amount of
hills/mile is about the same as on your average Glenn Schreiber ride,
or even a bit less. I mean, this is nothing in comparison to the
Turkey Hill (AKA Pedal PA Training Ride), which is one long steep hill
right after another. (On Saturday's ride there was only one really bad
hill, at least only one hill bad enough to force me to use my granny
gear.) On the other hand, Sat's ride was 108 miles long, and it did
get to you after awhile. I found myself standing up for alot of hills
at the end, mainly because the muscles that I use to go up hills
sitting down were too tired. Today, the day after, my thighs ache a
bit. On the upside, the hills gave us some wonderful descents! </p>

<p> Route rating: fantastic! It was just one nice road after another.
Almost all the roads were light in traffic. There were a few that were
just amazing, going thru' tall woods or going by open fields. We also
made short trips thru' little towns. There were some great views.
Once, coming down off a big hill, we looked down and saw a body of
water far away and far below. Half an hour later, we were there at the
reservoir!(Well, OK, maybe it was a different reservoir, since there
were two close together.) Joe grew up in one area that we passed
thru', and gave us some local history. </p>

<p> Since Pete and I got ahead alot, we were often following Joe's cue
sheet, and we found it to be very good. Even turns onto unmarked roads
were clearly described and easy to find (example: "R on Mine Road,
poorly marked, over bridge and up hill"). You can run the ride the the
cue sheets alone, and Pete said he was contemplating doing it in
October, when the leaves will be really spectacular. If I'm around,
I'd be interested in helping him. </p>
