<h1>My Favorite Cycling Productss</h1>

<blockquote>

Here are some of my favorite cycling products. For some of these
entries, the "product" is just a general type of thing. This is
usually when I find an item useful, but don't generally prefer one
brand to another. Other times I name specific brands, if I think the
brand is really better than others.

<h4>Pumps</h4>
<blockquote>

<p>I have positive experience with only two pumps that I carry with me on
the bike:</p>

<p> The first is the <b>Blackburn Mammoth</b>. It's a very durable pump that
works well and inflates MTB tires quickly. However it only really work
well for low pressures: it's difficult to get the pressure over 45psi.
This isn't exactly a mini-pump, but it does mount on a bracket that
goes between your bottle cage and frame, so it nestles up to your doun
tube. I've had mine since '96 and the only thing I've had to do to it
was replace the little rubber bits on the inside when they wear
out. Replacement kits are easy to find. I have heard of some people
having the pin holding in the handle coming out and thus losing the
handle, but mine seems a good enough fit that this doesn't happen. </p>

<p> The second is the <b>Zefal HP</b>. This is not a mini-pump. The
one I have, the HP X2 has slightly less volume than the Blackburn
Mammoth. But it can inflate a tire easily to 100psi. I've had mine
since... '94? '95?  A long time, and I've never needed to do anything
to it except oil the shaft a bit.</p>

<p> Neither of these have pressure gauges. I have a track pump with a
pressure gauge at home, so that's how I keep the tires up to the
proper pressure. I use the Blackburn or Zefal only when I have a
puncture when I'm out riding. Then I inflate it to what I think is
roughly the right pressure, then finish my ride and then inflate it to
the exact right pressure with the track pump. It's fine to have your
tires sligtly under or over-inflated for a short period. Only when I'm
touring do I worry about exact pressure, since I won't be able to
inflate with my track pump in the evening, and for that I take along a
separate pressure gauge.</p>

<p> I recommend one of these pumps because they work when you get them,
and they continue to work pretty much forever. I've tried quite a few
other pumps, but without exception they leak, or they are so small
that it takes forever to inflate the tires. Of course I haven't tried
all other pumps, so there may be others that work as well and are as
durable as those two above. </p>

<h4>Pedals</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I have <b>Shimano double-sided SPD pedals</b> on almost all my
bikes. I like them enough that they are the featured pedal in my
article on <a href="clipless.html">clipless pedals</a>. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Dynamos</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I like dynamos in general, because they stay permanently attached
to your bike and so will be there when you need them, are
exceptionally unlikely to be stolen, provide a brighter light than
almost all lights without external battery packs, and are very
reliable. </p>

<p> But of dynamos, the ones I like best are the <b>hub dynamos</b>. Hub
dynamos have all the advantages of dyanmos above, plus the advantage
that the never slip, and they offer so little resistance to your
pedalling that you can't even really feel it. Both the Shimano and
Schmitd hub dynamos (see review <a href="schmidt.html">here</a>) are
excellent products. They both have very low drag when they are
powering a bulb (see Chris Juden's <a
href="dynotest.html">Dynotest</a>). The Shimano has almost the same
amount of drag off as it does when on, but the Schmitd has almost no
drag when off. The Schmitd is clearly the king of dynamos, but it
costs roughly twice the price of the Schmitd, making the Schimano a
bette choice for a commuter on a budget. </p>

<h4>MTB grips</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> My favorite grips are made by <b>Serfas</b>. They are not too fat
for easy gripping by my small hands, they are squidgey so they provide
lots of cusioning to keep my hands from going numb, and the rubber
compound is tacky to help me keep my grip even in downpours. What more
can you ask for? </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>MTB bar ends</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> Although it isn't carrently fashionable to use bar ends on your
MTB bars, I do anyway. I like having a change of hand position, both
to give my hands/arms some variety, and to alter my weight
distribution. When I'm going up hills I you need to shift your weight
forward to keep the front wheel on the ground, and I find bar ends the
most effective way of doing that. Of all the bars ends I've tried, I
find the ones that have a welded bend in the to be the most
useful. They allow a wider variety of hand positions than most bars
ends, including a position on the welded extension, which put my hands
almost parallel to the handlebars, but further away. My favorite of
these are the <b>KF bar ends</b>, distributed by Fisher in the the
UK. They're my favorites because they have a neutral gray color with a
non-slip matt paint, and because they are very reasonably priced:
around 12 quid last time I bought some. </p>

<h4>Bell</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> The <b>Incredibell</b> deserves a mention for being very small,
having a very loud DING, and lasting quite a long time. I've had other
bells, but they didn't ding as loudly, or the springs on the clapper
wore out. They come in goes-with-all-bikes black. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Drop handlebar</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> Most manufacturers seem to think that if you want drop bars, you
want to race, so you want a stretched-out, low position. So they go
quite a bit forward before curving down, and the drops are quite a bit
below the stem area. The <b>3T Morphe bars</b> are a welcome
change. They allow the same change of hand positions, but just don't
go as far forward nor as far down. They also curve back from the stem
area towards the rider slightly before heading forward.  This means
you get plenty of hand positions, but aren't as stretched out at the
brake lever hoods, nor as low on the drops. Perfect for those of us
who want to improve our aerodynamics over straight bars, but don't
want an uncomfortable super-aero, stretched out position. The only
problem is that they don't come narrow enough for small women to
use. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Tire levers</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> Of all the tire levers I've tried, the red white and blue <b>Zefal
tire levers</b> work best. They have a very thin end which slips in
easily between the rim and the tire bead, and the shape seems just
right for prying the tire off the rim. They don't break as easily as
some tire levers, although if you've got a really really stubborn
tire, they will stretch and then break. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Socks</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I am a big fan of <b>Thorlo</b> socks. I know they aren't
cycle-specific, but whenever I'm cycling I'm highly likely to be
wearing <a href="http://www.thorlo.com/">Thorlos</a>.  I bought a few
initially just to try them out, and they have impressed me how well
they have treated my feet, and how long they have lasted. They come in
lightweight varieties for summer, and warm thick varieties for winter.
They may seem very expensive for socks, but in my opinion they're well
worth it. </p>

<h4>Cold weather riding gear</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> Over the years I have collected together equipment that lets me
ride outdoors in just about any weather, For the cold wet weather of
Britain, my favorite items are: Gore-Tex helmet cover, Activent
jacket with pit zips, jerseys with hoods, padded long tights, and
Shimano winter boots.  See my article about <a href="cold.html">riding
in the cold</a> for more info </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Year round riding gear</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> I have quite a few <b>wicking tops</b>. These take the form of long and
short sleeve T-shirts, turtlenecks (polonecks) and high-neck shirts
with zips. I even have a couple that look like polo shirts, having a
button neck and knit collar. These tops, like the Thorlo socks, aren't
cycling specific. They don't have pockets in back and are almost
always a solid color. They are useful as part of a layering system
when it's cool, and for summer when you want to look more casual. They
are incredibly useful for travel, as they take up less space in your
bag than cotton tops and don't wrinkle. They are ideal for bike
touring: after your shower in the evening put on a clean T-shirt, wear
the same T-shirt the next day on the bike. This saves taking separate
tops for on and off the bike. </p>

<p> Items made of CoolMax are very comfortable, but soon they start
looking very beat up, as the fabric pills easily, so they are most
useful for layering or when you don't care that your shirt looks
funny. The mesh-like fabric of Lowe Alpine shirts doesn't seem to pill
and thus stays looking nice for much longer. Nike Dri-FIT clothing
also seems pill-resistant. I have a few other kinds, from makes such
as Mountain Hardware and Rohan, but I haven't had them long enough to
know whether they will pill or not. </p>

</blockquote>
<h4>Water carriers</h4>
<blockquote>

<p> Water is essential for riding. <b>Hydration packs</b> (aka
Camelbaks) are little backpacks that contain a plastic bladder and
hose to hold water, and usually have some amount of extra space to
carry tools, food, clothing, etc. They are use mainly for mountain
biking. Many mountain bikes, especially full suspension bikes, have no
useful water bottle cages. Even riders with two good bottle cages
often use hydration packs, because they allow you to carry more
water. Furthermore, when you're riding off-road the water bottles can
get covered with mud, which makes them disgusting to drink out of.</p>

<p> In winter, I tend to use hydration packs even for road
riding. When I'm out in weather at or near freezing, my water gets
painfully cold very quickly. With a hydration pack, the heat from my
back keeps the water from getting too cold and keeps me drinking. I
tend to put warm water in the bladder to begin with (a mix of half
boiling water and half cold water staight from the tap is about the
right temperature for me). It gradually cools off to cool (rather than
bitter cold) over the course of a ride. When I drink I find that the
water in the drinking tube has cooled off a bit, but if I keep
drinking, I get lots of warm water. Warm water might not sound very
appealing, but if it's bitter cold, having pleasantly warm water
heading down your throat feels nice and encourages you to drink. </p>
