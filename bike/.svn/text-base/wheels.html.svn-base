<p> Everyone wants strong wheels that stay true and don't buckle. On
top of that, they want them light and cheap. Well, the good news is
that you actually can go a long ways towards getting this ideal
wheel. This article aims to cover the basics of what you need to know
to approach this, whether you want to make your own wheels, or whether
you want to select parts for a wheel that someone else will build for
you. </p>

<p> Almost everything I know about wheelbuilding comes from reading
Jobst Brandt's book <i>The Bicycle Wheel</i>. If you want to be an
expert in wheelbuilding, buy it and read it. This article has only a
small amount of info that isn't contained in the book. My main
purposes are to provide info on parts of wheels for people who want
others to build their wheels, and to inspire people who are thinking
of building their own wheels. Click <a href="bwheel-rev.html">here</a>

<a name="strong"><h2>What makes a strong wheel?</h2></a>

<blockquote>

<p> The strength of a wheel comes mostly from the spokes, and secondly
from the rim. To have a strong, durable wheel, the quality of the
wheelbuilding is far more important than the quality of the
parts. </p>

<p> Most people seem to think that wheels fail in impacts because
spokes break. In fact this isn't true. Most of the time when you have
a buckled wheel, you'll find that despite the now potato-chip shape of
your wheel, the spokes are all intact. </p>

<p> Wheels collapse when one of more of your spokes loses tension as a
result of an impact. Obviously, the spokes that lose tension are the
ones right at the point of impact. Then there's nothing supporting the
rim, and it twists. The tighter your spokes are to begin with, the
further they have to go before they lose tension.  Thus a high-tension
wheel is one that will resist impacts well. </p>

<p> And yes, spokes do break, but it's not usually as the result of an
impact, typically they just break as you're rolling along. Spokes
break as a result of fatigue. If your wheel is loose, then every time
the wheel goes around, it flexes a tiny bit, and eventually it
breaks. In fact spoke breakages are the most telling sign of wheels
that don't have high enough tension. If your spokes are tight, the
spoke doesn't move as the wheel turns, so they can last much
longer. Thus a high-tension wheel is one that will last a long time
with few spoke breakages. </p>

<p> The rim does contribute to the strength of the wheel, which is why
rims for downhill mountain biking or expedition style touring are
quite wide. However, they do this at the expense of quite a bit of
weight. While you don't want a rim that's too wimpy for your intended
use, the best way to increase the strength of your wheel is to
increase the spoke count and make sure the spokes are about as tight
as they can be. </p>

<p> Another thing that affects the strength of the wheel is the amount of
dishing. This is mainly a problem with the rear wheel, although it is
an issue with front wheels with disc brakes as well. On a normal front
wheel, you have flanges equidistant from the center of the hub, and
spokes go from these flanges to the rim. The spokes coming from each
flange go at the same angle to the rim. On the other hand, consider a
rear wheel. The right side of the hub has to have room for lots of
sprockets, so the right side flange is much closer to the center than
the left side flange. Thus if the rim is aligned with the center of
the hub as it should be, the left side spokes will be more slanted
than the right side spokes (in some cases the right hand spokes are
nearly vertical). Thus, in order to keep the rim in the center, the
right hand spokes will have to be much tighter than the left hand
spokes. When the wheelbuilder is tensioning the wheel, the right side
spoke will reach their maximum tightness long before the left spokes
will. It is the weakness of the less-tight left hand spokes that makes
a highly dished wheel (one where the angle difference between the left
and right spokes is great) less strong and less durable than a wheel
with less dish. </p>

<p> In order to offset the growing numbers of cogs used in the rear
wheel, the total width of hubs has been expanding. Fixed gear track
hubs have an over-locknut (basically, the width of the space between
the dropouts on the bike) width of 110mm.  The old 5 and 6-speed
screw-on hubs have a width of 126mm. Now hubs are usually 130mm wide
for road use, 135mm wide for off-road or touring use, and 140mm to
160mm wide for tandems. The idea with the wider hubs is to put more
distance between the right flange and the center of the hub, so that
there still will be a decent slant to the right hand spokes. You can
then move the left hand flange in a bit to try to make the angle more
equal. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="ingredients"><h2>Ingredients</h2></a>

<a name="hubs"><h4>Hubs</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> At the center of it all is your hub. Almost all hubs have aluminum
shells and flanges (the bits of the hub with spoke holes). First, it's
lighter than steel. Second, the flanges deform a bit to support the
spokes better. (This is why if you build a wheel using an old hub, you
should look closely at the hub and lace it up the same way as it was
used before.) </p>

<p> For the purposes of building a wheel, what you want are flanges
that are going to support the spokes properly and aren't going to rip
apart. To achieve this, the main thing to look for is a hub that's
built via forging rather than being CNC machined. CNC machining allows
the manufacturer to make all sorts of fancy shapes, but the result <a
href="http://sheldonbrown.com/dp-forging.html">isn't as strong</a> as
an equivalent forged part. </p>

<p> In my opinion, there isn't much point in buying anything other
than Shimano of Campagnolo hubs. They are good quality forged hubs and
are good value for money. The only exception is if you want disc
brakes. Shimano have gotten into the game only recently, and their
offerings aren't as good as others yet. In particular they're quite a
bit heavier than most other hubs. But given their track record, in a
few years they'll have top-notch disc hubs. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="rims"><h4>Rims</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> Rims should be made of aluminum. Steel may last longer, since the
sidewalls don't wear out under braking as with aluminum rims, but they
are an absolute nightmare when it's wet. If you've got steel rims in
the rain you're more likely to stop yourself by putting your foot down
than by using the brakes. The only way to make steel rims work in the
wet is to use leather brake blocks, which wear out very quickly. In
addition, steel rims are heavier than aluminum ones. Wheels with alu
rims also survive impacts better: they are less stiff than steel rims,
so they bend a little bit under an impact, spreading the load to more
spokes. This helps to prevent spokes from losing tension and
collapsing the wheel. </p>

<p> Rims can vary in cross-section from a simple squared-U shape, to a
multi-cavity box. In general, the bigger the cross-section, the more
walls, and the thicker the walls are, the stronger the rim is. For
most purposes, a narrowish (say 19 to 23mm width) single cavity (a
simple box) rim will do fine. If you want something stronger you can
get wider rims (for off-road and touring use) or deeper rims (for fast
road use). The deep-section rims have the additional advantage of
being a fair bit more aerodynamic than one with a more square
profile. </p>

<p> Most better rims have steel eyelets lining the holes for the
spokes. These distribute the stress of the spokes to a slightly larger
section of the inner wall of the rim, making the rim less likely to
crack. Some box-section rims have "double eyelets" which form a little
cylinder in the cavity between the walls of the rim. This can help
distribute stress from the spoke to the other wall of the cavity (the
one nearer the tire) and also helps to prevent your nipples from going
wandering in the cavity while you're lacing up the
wheel. Unfortunately, many rims are made with only single
eyelets. </p>

<p> Rims are extruded as straight bits, then coiled up into circles,
and then the ends of the hoops are joined together. The old way to put
rims together was to simply line them up accurately, put a small
insert in the cavity, and press the two ends of the rim together. The
newer way to do this is to weld the ends together, and then machine
the sidewalls so they are even. The benefits of the old system were
simplicity. Sometimes there would be a slight misalignment at the
join, and this would result in the join catching at your brakes.
However, the braking quickly wore this smooth. The benefit of the new
system is that it's nicer right out of the box: there is no unevenness
at the join. In addition the little ridges left by the machining
initially improves your braking performance, but this wears off
quickly, leaving smooth aluminum.  The drawback is that it's a more
expensive process which leaves the walls thinner. Of course you can
argue that the walls are designed thicker to start out with, so
machining leaves them with the right wall thickness. But then this is
a waste of materials, and you're likely to end up with a varying wall
thickness. </p>

<p> What the pinned or welded-and-machined argument boils down to is
the initial impression.  Once your brakes have worn down the
unevenness of the join or the little machined ridges, both rims
perform the same, except that the walls of the machined rims may be
thinner or even an uneven thickness. Welded-and-machined rims cost
quite a bit more than the old pinned rims. Given a choice, I would buy
pinned rims exclusively, but they are getting hard to find. I do
sometimes manage to pick them up at bike rallies, and when I find them
there they're generally dirt cheap. </p>

<p> Some rims meant to go into rear wheels have spoke holes that are
offset to one side. The idea is that you build up the wheel with the
spoke holes offset towards the non-drive (left) side of the rear
wheel. This decreases the angle of the left spokes while increasing
the angle of the right spokes. With more equal angles, they are more
equal in tension as well, allowing the left hand spokes to be tighter
when the wheel is tensioned up. This theoretically makes the wheel
stronger, but there doesn't seem to be any proof that it works in
practice. As for me, I'm convinced by the theory and tend to by
asymmetric rear rims, unless I'm buying vintage pinned rims, which
definitely don't come in asymmetric versions. </p>

<p> Rims can have several finishes put on them. Some finishes are
strictly decorative, giving a nice color to the rim. Hard anodizing
(Mavic calls this CD) is touted by rim manufacturers as something that
makes the rim stronger or longer-lasting. However, it is best avoided.
If the anodizing is on the sidewall of the rim, then it will make the
sidewall last slightly longer: first the black stuff wears off the
brake surface, and then the aluminum underneath starts to wear. So
theoretically your sidewalls could last a bit longer. However, this
coating wears off quickly, so this is of minimal benefit. Furthermore,
the anodizing decreases braking power considerably. You'll be eager
for that black stuff to wear off your rim as then your brakes will
start to work again... In fact some rims are machined after anodizing
so the rim starts off with a clean braking surface. </p>

<p> You might then think that once the sidewalls have been scraped
clean by your brakes (or the machining) that you'll then have some
protection from the bits of it still clinging to the spoke
bed. However, this not only does no good, but can lead to premature
failure of your rim. The anodized layer is hard and brittle. Rims do
flex slightly as they go around, and the anodizing can crack. These
cracks can then propagate into your rim, and then the spokes can rip
out of their holes. I'm not sure how seriously to take this danger of
cracking. After all, I've had some hard anodized Mavic MA40 rims for
years and have had no problems with cracking, so it may do no harm to
your wheels. But it certainly won't do any good either. If you really
want black rims, go for a cosmetic anodizing instead. </p>

<p> A ceramic coating on your rims is a more useful thing. This
coating takes ages to wear off, and in fact doesn't come off at all
unless you nick it with a rock. Once it starts to come off it will
gradually flake off, but even if you ride in a very rocky area you can
still get greatly increased rim life. In addition, braking in the wet
is improved. There are some downsides though. First, the cost. The
ceramic coating can just about double the price. If you generally
retire wheels due to trashing the rims rather than wearing them
through, ceramic rims will not be cost-effective. Second, the coating
insulates the rim. Usually when you brake, the heat of braking goes
into the rim where it is then dissipated. The ceramic layer prevents
this, so all the heat stays in your brake blocks, and they can
melt. You need to buy special brake pads for use with ceramic rims to
prevent this. Third, although braking in the wet is better with
ceramic rims, even with ceramic-specific pads it isn't quite as good
in the dry as bare alu rims. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="spokes"><h4>Spokes</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> Spokes are mostly made from steel. On very expensive wheels, you
can get titanium, carbon fiber, or aluminum spokes, but steel is the
standard choice for several reasons. First, steel is cheap. Second, it
is strong and has good fatigue resistance. Third, it's easy to cut
smooth, strong threads in it for the nipples. </p>

<p> So the main things you need to ask yourself is: what shape
(profile), how many spokes, and what thickness? First, shape. Almost
all spokes are round in cross section. If you want the wheels for time
trialling or triathlon, where you'll be going very fast and
aerodynamics are important, you can get ones that are a bit flattened
in profile. However, if you get them too flattened, you won't fit them
through the hole in the hub. You can get special hubs for this if
you're desperate for very areo wheels. </p>

<p> Second, number. Low spoke count wheels are trendy nowadays. But
let's face it: spokes really don't weigh all that much, and they are
really what gives the wheel its strength. So you really gain very
little by using few spokes. Consider, for example, Rolf wheels. They
have very few spokes, but the rims have to be heavier in order to
provide structure for the wheel in the large gap between
spokes. </p>

<p> Still, if you're very light and ride only on the road you'll be
putting less stress on your wheels than if you're heavy or ride
off-road, so you can get away with fewer spokes. As a general guide:
for road riding, 32 spokes make a good durable wheel, while if you're
large, ride off-road, or go touring, 36 spokes is better. If you're
light and want a light wheel, 28 spokes will do. 28 spokes is also
fine for a racing wheel, where you're willing to trade off some
strength for speed (reduced spoke count makes for reduced areo drag)
and lightness. For off-road riding, the greater strength of MTB rims
(their smaller diameter and wider profile) means that most people can
get away with 32 spokes. Heavy people or people who want to carry a
significant load off-road, dirt jumpers, or downhillers would be
better off 36 spokes. Tandems generally need more than 36 spokes: 40
or 48 is the norm. </p>

<p> Third, thickness. Here, you not only have a choice of how thick
you want the ends of the spoke to be, but also a choice of having
spokes that are narrower in the middle. The spokes that are thinner in
the middle are called double butted. Double butted spokes are
definitely the way to go. They are slightly lighter than straight
gauge spokes, but their main advantage is that they make a stronger
wheel. The thinner middle section allows them to stretch a bit when
the wheel is hit, spreading the load to neighboring spokes to help
distribute the impact. This helps to prevents the elbow near the
spokes head from flexing (which leads to fatigue and spoke breakage),
and also takes the stress away from the rim wall near the
nipples. </p>

<p> One of the most common myths about wheels is that double-butted
spokes will make your wheels weaker. Where people get this idea from,
I have no idea. Spokes almost never break in the middle, only at the
ends (usually near the spoke head), so common sense should tell anyone
that a wheel built from double-butted spokes will be at least as
strong as one built from straight gauge spokes. In fact because of
their greater elasticity, double-butted spokes result in a stronger
wheel. </p>

<p> In general, the thicker the spoke is near the head, the stronger
it will be. However since spokes mainly fail from fatigue (see above,
under What makes a strong wheel?) if the wheel is built well, this
does not make a big difference. So don't go thinking that to have
strong wheels, you need to have super-thick spokes. In fact you'd be
better off by having more thinner spokes to distribute the load
better. </p>

<p> I tend to use 14/15/14 gauge (2mm/1.8mm/2mm) DT stainless steel
spokes in all my wheels, mainly because that's what the local bike
shop stocks. I wouldn't hesitate to use 15/16/15 gauge
(1.8mm/1.6mm/1.8mm) spokes if they were as easy to come by. You can
also get spokes that are drastically thinner in the middle than they
are at the edges, such as DT's Revolution spokes, which are 14/17/14
or 15/17/15 gauge. I wouldn't use these because it's hard to prevent
spoke windup (twisting of spokes) with these spokes as they have so
little torsional rigidity. However, if you're getting the wheels built
by someone else, use them by all means as long as you don't mind the
extra cost. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="nipples"><h4>Nipples</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> With nipples there's much less choice. You get nickel-plated brass
ones, or aluminum ones. The brass ones are stronger, and the brass
helps to lubricate the threads a little. (However, this alone is
usually not sufficient, so it's best to put some grease or oil on the
threads of your spokes before putting on the nipples to make sure they
don't bind when the tension is getting high.) The alu are lighter, but
in most people's opinion there is not enough of a weight savings to
make up for their shortcomings. Serious wheelbuilders use brass
nipples. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="tools"><h2>Tools for the DIY approach</h2></a>

<blockquote>

<p> First and foremost you need a spoke wrench. The best one you can
get without paying a fortune is the Spokey. It's a cheerful plastic
disc with nipple-gripping bit on one side. The advantages of the
Spokey are that the textured disc is easy to hold and gives you lots
of leverage, it grips the nipple well, and it's inexpensive.  Just
make sure you get the right size for the nipples you use. </p>

<p> While it's possible to build a wheel without a wheel truing stand
(using your brake blocks to tell you when the wheel is out of true)
the task is made immensely easier with the use of a proper stand. You
need to look for several things. First, it's useful if the feelers for
the left and right sides of the rim can be moved independently, so you
can choose which bumps to take care of first. Second, you need a gauge
that goes up against the edges of the rim so you can check radial
trueness. </p>

<p> I've used two truing stands.  I wasn't pleased at all the the TACX
Scorpio. The feelers didn't move independently. One knob moved them
both in or out, and you had very little fine control over this
movement. In addition it had nothing to help you with radial
trueness. The Minoura Workman Pro I now own is much better. The
feelers are simple screws, so you can move them independently and have
fine control over how close they are to the rim, and there's a little
movable plate for radial trueness. My only complaint is that the
plastic bit that holds the feelers and the plate has cracked. I
haven't been abusing it, so this suggests that it isn't very
durable. It still hasn't broken though. Regular Performance catalog
shoppers should note that the Minoura Workman Pro is exactly the same
as the Performance Spin Doctor Truing Stand. </p>

<p> Finally, you need a dishing tool to make sure that the rim is
centered between in the middle of the hub. These are pretty basic and
all are similar. I have one by Minoura, but I'm sure any would do. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="building"><h2>Building a wheel</h2></a>

<a name="lacing"><h4>Lacing</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> Making a wheel from the constituent parts has basically two
phases. First, you put everything together. This is called lacing.
I've done this enough times that it's pretty automatic, but there's no
point in me typing it all out, as others have described it so well
already. See Part II of Jobst Brandt's book <i>The Bicycle Wheel</i>,
which has excellent illustrations. Or see Sheldon Brown's <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html#lacing">wheelbuilding</a>
pages. I'll only mention here that you should thoroughly grease the
spoke threads before you start. That makes them easy to turn in the
nipples and allows you to get the needed tension.
</p>

</blockquote>

<a name="tensioning"><h4>Tensioning and truing</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> Once you've laced the wheel up, screw all spokes in until the
threads of the spokes just disappear into the nipple. Then shove the
thing on your wheel truing stand and get tightening. </p>

<p> Basically, the idea is to bring up the tension of the wheel while
maintaining lateral trueness (lack of side to side wiggles), radial
trueness (even distance of rim to hub) and dishing (equal distance from
rim to locknut on both sides of wheel). For the first, you have the
feelers feeling the sides of your rim to tell you when they're out of
true. For the second, any decent truing stand will have a bar that you
put next to the rim, and where it scrapes, that part is further from
the hub. For dishing, you have your dishing tool, which is basically
an arch with feet on the ends of the arch (you put that on the rim)
and a feeler hanging down from the top of the arch. You adjust the
feeler so that it just hits the locknut on one side of the wheel, and
hopefully it just hits the locknut on the other side. </p>

<p> If the thing is out of true laterally, what I do is try to bring up
the tension at the same time as I'm truing, by finding a place where
the rim is out of true, and finding a looser spoke opposite the bulgy
side (find looser spoke by plucking), and tightening that until it's
roughly the same tension as the spokes near it. If there isn't a
looser spoke, I tighten up two or three of the spokes a bit (half turn
maybe) to bring up the tension. </p>

<p> If the thing is out of true radially, I tighten a few spokes near the
bulge about a half turn, and ones next to those about a 1/4 turn,
tightening spokes on both sides of the wheel. (Again my goal is to
increase tension as I'm doing my truing). </p>

<p> If the thing is dished wrong, set up the feeler on the dishing tool so
that it hits the locknut on one side, but has a gap between feeler and
locknut on the other side. (Only do the dishing bit when the rim is
laterally true; if you have side-to-side bulges you get different
results depending on where you put the dishing tool on the rim.) Say
we're looking at the wheel so that the gap side is on the right. Now,
your goal is to bring the rim further to the left to try to close up
that gap. What you need to do is tighten the spokes on the left
(non-gap) side. Don't tighten too much at once here. Maybe 1/2 (or
even 1/4, if the gap isn't too big) turn per spoke on the left hand
side.  This will bring the rim slightly closer to the left, giving a
small gap on the left side, and making the gap on the right side
smaller. Hopefully the gaps are now the same size, and when you
realign your feeler, you'll get it just touching the locknut on both
sides. </p>

<p> Your goal is to get a wheel that's true in all three senses, and
tensioned enough. "Enough" is hard to gauge when you're starting out,
but a rough rule of thumb is that the nipples should be quite hard to
turn when you're finished. If you've managed to get all three aspects
true but the wheel isn't to a high enough tension, then tighten all
spokes about 1/2 turn, and retrue. Repeat until done. </p>

<p> When you're tightening (or even loosening spokes), turn the spoke
a bit past the amount you're trying to tighten (or loosen) then back
off. So if you want to tighten by 1/2 turn, then tighten by 3/4 turn,
then loosen 1/4 turn. This helps prevent spoke windup (twisting of
spokes). Unfortunately, despite your best efforts, you can end up with
windup. This is the method I use to let the spokes unwind. Put a
magazine on the floor and pull the quick release skewer out of the
hub. Put on end of the hub on the magazine, and put your hands on two
opposite places on the rim, then lean your weight on your hands. This
releases the tension on the lower spokes just beneath your hands and
lets them unwind if they've got wound up, making a pinging sound. Go
around the rim this way, then turn over and repeat. You'll then have
to put the wheel back on the truing stand to make sure this hasn't
made the wheel go out of whack. If you've gotten spoke windup and you
don't do this, you'll hear the pinging noises when you go to ride your
bike with your new wheel. </p>

</blockquote>

<a name="stress"><h4>Stress relieving</h4></a>

<blockquote>

<p> Once you've got your wheel all tight and true, you want to stress
relieve it. This relieves minute stresses that may have built up in
the spokes. Again, see <i>The Bicycle Wheel</i> or Sheldon Brown's <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html#lacing">wheelbuilding</a>
pages for info on how to do this. </p>
