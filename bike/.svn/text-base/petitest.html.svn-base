<h4>Chris Juden examines bikes for the
vertically challenged - with the help of fourteen small women!</h4>

<blockquote>

<table cellpadding=5 align=right width=45% border=1>
<tr><td> <p> This article was written by Chris Juden in 1994. Although
some of the equipment has changed (bikes typically have more gears,
for example) the needs of women cyclists haven't, nor has the fact
that most manufacturers don't provide bicycles to meet these
needs. The article concentrates on touring bikes but will be equally
useful for a woman looking for a road (racing) bike. It won't be as
helpful for a woman looking for a MTB, although many issues such as
top tubes that aren't too long and appropriately sized cranks are
still relevant. </p>

<p> This page introduces the problem, and there are quite a few
accompanying pages. </p>

<P>Women in general, and smaller women in particular, have a lot
of problems finding a comfortable bike. And after a week with fourteen
of them in some of the hardest country England can offer, I assure you
that this is not because they're an awkward and over-sensitive bunch
who can't accept that cycling's a physical activity! Given a bike that
really fitted them, with a good range of gears and brakes they could
actually reach, some of these women amazed even themselves by the
hills they could ride up and down. </P>

<P>If you look at the ranges of bicycles offered by mass producers and
compare their vital statistics with the UK population, you find that
they do a reasonable job of providing touring bikes for more than 90%
of men. The typical 5 percentile British male (p5, which means that 5%
measure less than this) stands 167cm (5'6) tall and fits a 51cm (20in)
frame. The median (p50) woman is actually slightly shorter than this
at 166cm (5'5), while Mrs 5% is only 155cm (5'1).</P>

<P>Big people tend to be more into sports and long-legged people are
probably over represented in the cycling population - which may
explain why manufacturers find it worthwhile providing the tallest 5%
of men with frames up to 64cm. A few also go down to 49 or
48cm. According to their seat tubes, these smaller frames ought to
suit the small to average woman, but when we look at their other
dimensions we find that they have not been reduced in proportion. Very
often the handlebars are just as far from the saddle, giving rise to
the justified complaint of feeling too stretched out. </P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Vive la difference!</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>It is frequently stated that women have shorter torsos and
longer legs than men of the same height. I've even repeated this
supposition myself, but I'm afraid that the data do not support it. A
general analysis of the adult population shows that big or small, man
or woman, the average person's inside leg is some 47% of stature. Of
course we are not all of average build, but men seem as likely as
women to have relatively longer or shorter legs. Almost 50% of my
height is leg - so I'm either a case in point or a freak! This ratio,
by the way, varied from 45% to 49% for the petite test women.</P>

<P>A woman's pelvic structure is, however, quite different. And women
do sit differently upon a bicycle: a little further back on the saddle
(partly but not only so as to find a bit that's wide enough!) and
apparently bend forward from a higher point on the spine. Both these
factors introduce a need for the handlebars to be nearer and higher in
relation to the saddle.</P>

<P>Flexibility of the spine varies greatly between individuals and
reduces with age, a factor which plays havoc with nice formulae for
designing bicycles on the basis of body dimensions. Young, athletic
women seem better able to cope with the too-stretched-out riding
position imposed upon them by a bike that is theoretically too long,
but saddle problems can arise from an accompanying forward tilt of the
pelvis. Less flexible individuals require higher and closer
handlebars.</P>

<P>There are, of course, a few smaller male cyclists too. A couple of
them contacted me about this test, mildly criticising its sexist
character and suggesting some solutions to the size problem. But
here's another difference: these chaps did not simply accept what is
served up by the trade. Women, I'm afraid, often lack the technical
interest and confidence to question the supposedly expert advice of
shop staff and more experienced cycling companions - all of whom are
usually men with a vested interest in providing something as near
standard-issue as possible. </P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Alice in Bicycleland</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Now we've accepted that there's a demand from smaller riders,
let's enter the Alice in Wonderland world of shrinking bicycles. Pick
up the bottle labelled Drink Me from the table and pour it over any
average-sized, 57cm (22½in) tourer. It shrinks pretty well down to
about 53cm (21in), reducing its length in proportion with height, at
which point you notice that the magic fluid missed the cranks and the
wheels. </P>

</blockquote>

<a name="cranks"></a>
<h4>Shrink the cranks</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Alice (who has also taken a swig) doesn't like her feet hitting
the front mudguard, and anyway: pedalling a 170mm circle makes the
knees of her shrinking legs bend too much, so she manages to shake a
few last drops onto the cranks. </P>

<P>Unfortunately it is much easier to fantasise about shorter cranks
than walk into a shop and buy any. Aside from children's sizes, a
choice in lengths is only offered by the most expensive models: and
even then is intended to let a man of average build fine-tune his
performance to a particular style of racing event rather than
something more or less right for all the rest of us. Thus those who
can afford it may obtain slight variations on 170mm, in 5mm or even
2.5mm steps, from 180 down to 160mm if you're lucky. (For the time
being TA also have 150mm.) In this respect big blokes fare as badly as
small women, but cranks that are too long do more damage to knees by
making them bend too much. [For advice on where to get unusual length
cranks, see <a href="cranks.html">Check your Cranks</a>.]</P>

<P>It's obvious when you think about it: the crank is just one part of
the thigh-shin-foot-crank linkage. Change the length of three of these
links and you should change the other in proportion, but it's
surprising how many minds cannot be opened to this obvious
reality. And the recommendations of those who do accept that varying
crank length is a good idea, fall well short of a truly proportional
relationship, probably in an attempt to reconcile the reader to the
limitations of what is available.</P>

<P>I have long recommended that cranks be about 20% of leg
length. Coincidentally, I've recently discovered the same figure was
found to be the optimum by a couple of Californian researchers using a
lab-full of machinery (Gross &amp; Bennett, 1976). Their conclusion
that the standard length of crank is too long for 60% of men and
almost 100% of women was not widely reported in the cycling press of
the day. Could this be because to fit 90% of (British) adults we'd
need cranks from 150 to 180mm long - a far wider range than that
provided by most potential advertisers? Of course, the human body is
quite adaptable and most people can tolerate some variation. Limits of
20% to 21% seem reasonable. People with dodgy knees are advised to
keep to the lower figure, while bigger than average feet can help
short legs accommodate longer than optimum cranks. </P>

<P>People who switch to shorter cranks may initially notice some loss
of power, but they soon develop a more rapid and fluid cadence -
previously inhibited by excessively long cranks. They can then develop
the same or more power by spinning a lower gear faster [see <a
href="pstroke.html">Improve your spin</a>], and should alter their
gears accordingly.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Smaller wheels for smaller people</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Proportional crank length only buys a bit of time for shrinking
Alice and her bike (until about 52cm or 20½in) at which point that
stubbornly 700C wheel not only catches up with the shrinking crank but
also prevents the head tube getting any shorter. What now? </P>

<P>The obvious thing to do is also to shrink the wheels. By doing this
we make the whole bike an exactly similar model of it's full-size
original. We've already seen that small people have the same
proportions - on average - as bigger ones, so why should bikes be any
different? Of course they shouldn't really. All the problems of toes
overlapping mudguards and head-tubes too short for the headset are
solved: everything falls neatly into place if the wheel is smaller
too.</P>

<P>Why don't smaller frames routinely have smaller wheels then? It's
because only the smallest adult sizes need them and big manufacturers
find it much simpler either to ignore inconveniently small potential
customers, and/or to mangle the frame geometry of their smallest
offered size so as to shoehorn the factory's standard wheel for that
model range into it. This artificially restricts the market for
smaller wheel sizes to children and a few specialised types of bicycle
such as folders and hpvs. The result is that those who accept that
smaller wheels are the solution and want to build bikes with them have
little choice of tyres and rims and their customers are put off by
poor spares availability.</P>

<P>Some framebuilders and one or two small manufacturers nevertheless
adopt this, the engineering solution. Most of them make both wheels
smaller, but the rear does not really need scaling down. </P>

<P>Leaving the rear big does not cause any rider fit or design
problems and has a few advantages. Rear tyres wear much (3 or 4 times)
faster, puncture and are damaged (likewise rear rims) more often than
front ones; hence the parts you're going to need to replace most often
are easy to replace and interchangeable with those used by your larger
companions. Against this stands the need to carry two spare tubes -
not that I would bother on a day-ride. I'd mend the rare front
punctures or in an emergency a larger tube can always be concertina'd
into a smaller tyre.</P>

<P>Low-profile racing bikes have made smaller front wheels more
acceptable, and they are found on a few bikes in America, notably the
Georgena Terry range specifically designed for women. Unfortunately
these are not imported here. All of the those who responded with
smaller wheels to the challenge of making a bike for our Petite Test
used the same size front and rear. This means that you must keep a
good stock of tyres at home, to deal with a more frequent need for
hard-to-get replacements, but in the long term should result in a
bigger market for alternatives to 700C; and I'm all in favour of that!
For some information on the alternatives see the section
<a href="pt-bits.html#wheels">
What size small wheel?</a>.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>But I must have 700C!</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>The simplest thing for those who won't bite the small wheel
bullet is to give up making the frame any shorter or lower and raise
the pedals instead. Shrinking Alice doesn't like this at all. She can
no longer stand over the frame, but has to hop off to the side,
leaving one leg hooked jauntily over the top tube. Okay, so we can put
in a sloping top-tube or even give her a step-through frame, but it's
still t-o-o  l-o-n-g. And if Alice wants to halt while seated by
putting just one toe to the floor - an action which taller riders take
for granted - she can't do so without lowering the saddle - which
makes her pedal inefficiently with over-bent knees. Smaller bikes
should have a lower bottom-bracket not a higher one.</P>

<P>The most obvious and dangerous problem with such long little frames
is that our Alice is so stretched out she can hardly reach the bars
and brakes. She feels less in control of the bike and so she is. She
cannot do U-turns and creeps down hills; and all this leaning forwards
causes acute saddle discomfort.</P>

<P>Shorter stems can help the length problem, but only a little, and
nice-looking stems only come in long extensions. Women, as I have
already observed, often like their handlebars higher, and a
custom-built stem can often transform an ill-fitting mass-produced
bike, by putting the handlebars precisely where you want them, at a
fraction the cost of a custom frame.</P>

<P>Short-reach brake levers are available but seldom fitted to
ready-made bikes. Braking is a subject in itself, for which see the
section <a href="pt-bits.html#blevers">The brake lever problem</a>.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Mangled angles</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>As frame size drops below 52cm the phrase 'variable geometry'
can take on a whole new meaning. Above this level it implies small
adjustments to the seat angle of a ½° or 1° plus or minus, so as to
fit the frame to the rider's body. From here on down it tends to
become a euphemism for wholesale alterations to the steering and
riding position in order to make the body fit the machine!</P>

<P>Reducing the head angle is relatively harmless and helps in three
ways. Shallower angles are accompanied by extra fork rake - allowing
the frame to be made some 15mm shorter per degree - while the
head-tube may be made slightly longer as it is swung further behind
the front wheel. But anything below 71° is uncharted water to most
framebuilders - who are understandably reluctant to tempt the vengeful
gods of steering geometry!</P>

<P>Due to the fact that common varieties of seat post place the part
of the saddle the rider sits on some way behind the line of the seat
tube, there's good reason for this line being a little steeper for
smaller riders. If 73° is right for the average-sized touring frame,
then 74° should suit the petite: a change which (in a small frame)
moves the bottom-bracket nearly 1cm further from the front wheel for a
given top-tube length. But this just isn't enough to sort out the
foot-in-wheel problem as Alice and her bike shrink through the 51cm
frame-size barrier, so the designer gets hold of the seat tube and
yanks it forwards by a good 2 or 3 degrees - sometimes even more! </P>

<P>A 77° seat angle brings the saddle about 3cm closer to the
handlebars compared to 74°. This would be all very well on a small
racing bike, since it brings the rider's weight further forward of the
pedals in a manner which helps the rider press harder upon them. But
our Alice does not want to pedal harder - after all she is supposed to
be touring - and finds to her discomfort that relaxing her pedalling
effort now requires a greater proportion of her weight to be supported
by hands and arms. </P>

<p> [The angles for the test bikes are given in the 
<a href="pt-specs.html#geometry">Geometry</a> section.]

</blockquote>

<h4>Compromise, compromise</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>The skilled custom builder will employ all these measures -
sloping top-tube; shallow head; steeper seat - in order to build a
frame that will somehow arrange standard-sized components around a
small-sized rider. For riders needing a touring frame under 50cm such
a frame can only be regarded as a compromise. If the builder is
skilled at interpreting the wishes of the rider that can be a
reasonably happy compromise, and certainly better than an off-the-peg
bike that is altogether too big.</P>

<P>If you can accept a smaller wheel this removes all the
compromises. Sloping top-tubes and small variations in geometry still
have a place in such designs: as a means to making the machine fit the
rider rather than vice versa. </P>

<P>The accompanying reviews of bikes supplied for this test should
give you an idea of what to expect from the builders concerned and the
various design strategies they have adopted. The problem is that
beginners won't want to spend custom-built prices on equipment, when
they don't yet know if they'll enjoy cycling. Sadly, the little lady's
first touring bike is most likely a ready-made model that doesn't fit:
and upon which she is never a really comfortable or effective
rider. This, in turn, ensures that she never enjoys cycling enough to
want to spend the kind of money it takes to get a properly fitted
custom job: catch 22! And many experienced riders don't have that kind
of money either.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>The ATB option</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>All the above assumes road bike sizing. Mountain or all-terrain
bikes (ATBs) come in much smaller sizes, which attracts the smaller
rider even if they have no intention of going off road. Nowadays the
frame weights of the best models are competitive with a 531ST tourer
and there's a limited selection of road-going tyres (with plenty of
narrow rims to suit thanks to the mountainbiker's disregard for
conventional tyre-fitting wisdom!). Fit these smaller tyres and the
pedals should not be quite so far off the road (you might even be able
to get a foot down in traffic) and there will be space for
mudguards. </P>

<P>So far so good, but these apparently smaller frames are also
proportioned for Mr average. You need to subtract 7 to 10cm (at least
3in) from the size of road bike you'd expect to ride when looking
instead at ATBs. This is because all the other proportions of the
frame are designed for someone who wants to crash land without
squashing his dangly bits against the top tube, and hence rides with a
foot or so of seat pillar showing beyond that apparently short seat
tube. Try riding an ATB you can just stand over and the bars will be
much too far from the saddle. The same applies to a lesser extent to
'hybrid' bikes - the frame size may be smaller but the whole bike
isn't.</P>

<P>In September, Mountain Biking UK published their own petite test
(did they get the idea from us I wonder) and concluded that the
smallest available, 14 to 15in frame models would be OK for women over
157cm (5'2). This is 1 or 2in less than can ride a 49cm (19½in) tourer
- but still leaves quite a lot in the lurch. </P>
