<h4>Introduction</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Women are built different from men, and this has implications on what
sort of bike they need. The explanation for this varies depending on
whom you talk to. According to a great many people, including Pete Bird
of <a href="http://www.tandemania.com/">Tandemania</a>, on average, a
woman will have longer legs and a shorter torso and arms than a man of
the same height. Thus a woman needs a bike with a shorter top tube and
higher handlebars to allow her to reach the handlebars more easily.
However, Chris Juden (the CTC's Technical Officer) states that
this is a myth, as shown by the stats found in the <a
href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/pip/9conres.htm">DTI's Adultdata</a>
information. Chris still supports the idea of higher and closer
handlebars, saying that women's backs seem to bend differently. Either
way, the result is the same: women often feel too stretched out on
standard bikes. </p>

<p> For more than a decade Roberts Cycles have been developing bikes for
women. Since the main goal in a woman's bike is a shorter saddle to
handlebar reach, small wheels are a common feature on womens
bikes. Roberts' bikes include racing style bikes based on 650c (ISO
571mm) wheels and expedition touring bikes based on 26" (ISO 559mm)
mountain bike wheels (the Rough Stuff). </p>

<p> In developing a bike for Audax-type use they considered using 26"
wheels.  However until recently, there was very little choice of road
tires for these wheels. Now there are quite a few slick tires, but
there isn't a very good selection of narrow ones suitable for Audax
use. Thus for the best selection of tires the 700c (ISO 622mm) wheel
is the way to go. </p>

<p> The Compact Clubman is a result of tinkering that Chas Roberts
describes as "a centimeter here, a degree there." The bike can be made
small enough to fit women down to about 5' tall. Women shorter than
that will have to use 26" wheels and accept the limited sizes of
tires.  </p>

<p> With so much effort put into making a 700c wheeled bike that works for
women, there is no room to change the geometry for specific purposes.
The intended use of the bike is reflected in the equipment and the
diameters and thickness of the frame tubes. The test bike is the Audax
style, with thin lightweight Reynolds 531 tubes, dual pivot brakes,
25mm tires, and narrow mudguards. It was made to my measurements. </p>

<p> In the test below I'll compare the Compact Clubman to the womens bikes
tested in C+96, especially the Cannondale, and my own Roberts Rough
Stuff. </p>

<h4>Frame: Short reach to the bars, springy frame</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/cc-headtube.jpg" alt="tall head tube"
 ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" width=192 height=376 hspace="5">

<p> The most obvious feature of the frame is the sloping top tube. The
seat tube is the usual length for me but the top tube joins the seat
tube well below the top. From there it slopes up sharply to the top of
the head tube. This results in a long head tube while preserving a
good crotch clearance for road use. </p>

<p> The head tube is incredibly long at 15.5cm. This allows the handlebars
to be higher and brings the handlebars closer to the saddle. The
latter works because the seat tube angle is steeper than the head
angle. For comparison, the head tube on my old steel touring bike (a
typical 19" bike) is 8.5cm.  Thanks to a 1cm spacer in the headset,
the top of the headset is about level with the seat post clamp. You
won't get a heads-down position on this bike. </p>

<p> The frame is beautifully fillet brazed except for the lugged bottom
bracket. Braze-ons abound, with two sets for water bottles, a pump peg
on the left seat stay, and a complete set of mudguard and rear rack
fixings. The mudguards attach neatly via bolts into the fork crown and
chainstay and seatstay bridges. There are little cable guides on the
head tube, keeping the cable housing neat and off the paint. </p>

<p> The frame is very flexible due to thin tubes. The highly curved
fork results in a large fork offset. This means that the fork flexes
more when you hit bumps, as there is more leverage on the fork. </p>

<p> I had about 2cm of gap between my toe and the mudguard on the Compact
Clubman. On the Cannondale, the only bike from the C+96 test that
actually fit me, I had 1cm of toe overlap despite smaller wheels and
tires and no mudguards. </p>

<p> The bottom bracket is quite low, which gives you a lower center of
gravity and makes it easier to put a toe down for red lights, but it
can lead to scraped pedals if you pedal in tight corners. </p>

<h4>Handling: Does exactly what you want it to.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> This bike is easy to ride, going just where you want with a minimum of
effort. It has very steady straight-line handling, but goes around
corners as fast as you would like. I felt especially confident going
down hills. Perhaps the knowledge that the frame would cope well with
any bumps I might meet encouraged me to let go the brakes and tuck in
for a fast ride down.  The Cannondale handles just slightly faster,
responding a bit more quickly to rider input. However, there is little
to choose between them. </p>


</blockquote>

<h4>Wheels: Good parts, hand made to last</h4>

<blockquote>


<p> The front hub is a shiny slender Campag Athena, while the rear is a
fat matte Deore XT. While they don't match in looks, they do in
performance. They both pass the spoke wrench test, which lets you check
friction in the bearings. In both cases, attaching a spoke wrench to a
spoke caused the wheel to slowly spin until it was rebalanced. </p>

<p> The rims are Mavic T217, which are very strong. The only problem they
can have is rapid wearing of the braking surfaces, but this is mainly
a problem in off-road riding. However the wide profile of the T217s
look a bit out of place on this Audax style bike. Mavic MA2 rims would
look svelter, would be plenty strong and just as durable, as well as
being slightly lighter and much cheaper. </p>

<p> The spokes are DT stainless steel 14/15/14 double butted spokes, 36
per wheel. This is an excellent choice, as double butted spokes build
into a stronger, more durable wheel than straight gauge spokes. The
thinner middle allows them to temporarily stretch to absorb impacts,
taking the strain off the fatigue-prone ends, and allowing more spokes
to share the load. </p>

<p> The wheels are hand-assembled by Harry Rowland, and the result is a
set of well-tensioned wheels that should never need truing, barring a
large impact. These wheels ought to last until the braking surfaces
wear out. </p>

<p> The tires are 25mm Michelin Axial Select which are fine for Audax use. </p>


</blockquote>

<h4>Equipment: Works fine except for the rear indexing</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/cc-chainset.jpg" alt="Stronglight chainset"
 ALIGN="left" BORDER="0" width=312 height=252 hspace="5">

<p> The derailleurs and shifters are Campagnolo Veloce 9-speed, while the
hub and cassette are 8-speed Shimano.  Roberts used the Shimano hub
because its 135mm dropout spacing decreases the wheel dish. He wanted
to allow the use of integrated shifters and brake levers, but Shimano
STI levers were out. First, the shift cables prevent the use of a
handlebar bag. Second, unless you get very expensive ones they don't
allow you to trim the derailleur. This is essential to allow the
shifters to be used with non-Shimano chainsets with short cranks. </p>

<p> The Campag shifters are expecting a 4.55mm gap between sprockets, but
there is a 4.8mm gap between the Shimano sprockets. If you line of the
indexing at the middle of the cassette, it will be about 1mm out at
the ends. In practice you can set up the rear mech so that it works
well over the entire cassette, but it will not be tolerant of slight
misalignments. One way to avoid this, while sacrificing little in
convenience, would be to use Shimano bar-end shifters and derailleurs. </p>

<p> The chainset is the Stronglight ST1000 with 165mm cranks. The 1000 is
a good quality, reasonably priced chainset that comes in quite a range
of crank lengths. The small chainring is bolted to extensions on the
middle chainring, so it's easy to turn the chainset into a double. </p>

<p> The brakes, Shimano's RX100 long arm dual pivot brakes, stop the bike
effectively. The short 8cm stem and short-reach 3T Forma handlebars
help bring the brake/shift levers closer in.  Although the mudguard
are SKS there are no emergency releases on the fork mounts. </p>

<h4>Comfort: The most comfortable bike I have ridden</h4>

<blockquote>


<p> Comfort on a bike is determined by three things: shock absorbency,
rider position, and saddle. The saddle isn't worth discussing since
it's such a personal issue. I didn't get on with the Turbo saddle
provided with the bike, but I know women who swear by them. </p>

<p> The other aspects are less subjective, and this bike excels in them.
The frame is very flexible and does a great deal to smooth out road
shock. The flexibility of the frame is due to the tubes, which are
narrow diameter and have thin walls. My Rough Stuff has bigger
diameter tubes with thicker walls, resulting in a stiffer frame,
although the bike absorbs shock as well as the Compact Clubman due to
fatter, lower pressure tires.  </p>

<p> The Compact Clubman is built for comfort. The bikes tested in C+96
were built for speed. While two of the bikes (the Vision and the
Cannondale) did reasonably well at smoothing out some of the bumps,
the Compact Clubman makes them feel like boneshakers. The drawback is
that the Compact Clubman flexes when you really don't want it to. If
you stand up to pedal, you can feel the bike move from side to
side. If you pedal standing on the Cannondale, it doesn't give at all;
it just shoots forward. </p>

<p> The tall head tube and clever geometry bring the handlebars up and
closer to the saddle. This is the only bike where I have felt
comfortable riding on the brake lever hoods and the drops for extended
periods of time. </p>


</blockquote>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<blockquote>


<p> The Compact Clubman certainly is an extremely cleverly designed,
very comfortable bike. I wish I'd had a bike this comfortable years
ago. For several years I have been suffering from tendonitis in my
elbows due to excessive weight on my hands, and this bike would have
prevented the problem completely. </p>

<p> While the flexible frame will make it undesirable for sprinters,
it is just the thing for longer rides. It's light enough to keep
pedalling from being a chore, the mudguards keep you dry in uncertain
weather, and the shock-absorbing frame and more upright riding
position work to minimise body aches. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, I would never buy this bike. I just don't think it
makes any sense to build a bike this small out of 700c wheels. I think
it looks funny with the small frame with super-long head tube and big
wheels. I much prefer the looks of the <a href="cannon.html">
Cannondale</a> I tested. There small wheels have been used to make a
bike with much more traditional looks. </p>

<p> I take Roberts' point that there is a better selection of narrow
tires in 700c size, but by now the selection of narrow slick MTB tires
is good enough, and it will only continue to improve. </p>

<p> Roberts' workmanship is clearly excellent, and he's spent a great
deal of time and effort desiging this bike. But it's time for him to
abandon 700c wheels for such small bikes and put his skills into
making women's bikes out of MTB wheels. </p>
