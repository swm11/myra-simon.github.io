<h2>My First Off-road Race (Race #9)</h2>

<p> Today (Sunday 15 March) I was supposed to have done a team time
trial, but through bad organization we didn't manage to get our form
in on time. So instead I went for a ride in Thetford Forest with my
boyfriend Simon and friend Tony. Tony picked us up from our place at
about 10:30 (since his car takes 3 bikes, and our place is on the way
from his place to the forest), and we were in the forest rolling
around by 11:45.</p>

<p> The riding went like this: Tony, Simon, and I are about equally
fit, but they aren't as good at the technical stuff as I am, so I'd
fly ahead, and at every junction I'd wait for them to catch up. We
were having a good time. Although it was cloudy there was no rain, and
the temperature was about 10C (50 deg F), so we were plenty warm and
dry.</p>

<p> As we rode around, we noticed that there were lots of pieces of tape
and signs marking a race course. Some guys passed us (not racers, they
didn't have numbers on). When asked, they said that there was indeed a
race today. There are often races in Thetford Forest, as it has some
ace singletrack. No hills, but that's what you get here in East
Anglia...</p> 

<p> I thought: if there's a women's race, I'd like to try it. So we
wandered over to the registration area, getting there about 1pm. There
was indeed a women's race starting at 1:30. The beginners/fun race had
gone off in the morning, so I was told I had a choice of Pro/Elite,
Sport, or Masters. All of them would be doing 2 laps of the 7 mile
course. Being that I had never done an off-road race before I thought
that Pro/Elite was not a good idea, and you have to be 29 years or
younger to race Sport. So, being that I'm 32, Masters it was. There
were 3 women signed up for Sport, one for Pro/Elite, and none for
Masters, so it was a sure win for me if I did the race. The entry fee
was 12 pounds, but they told me that the prize money was more than the
entry fee. So I figured I'd give it a go, as long as Simon and Tony
were willing to stay that long in the forest. They were, and Simon had
the 12 pounds on him, so I registered and ate all the granola (cereal)
bars we'd brought with us, even though I was't feeling all that
hungry. I knew I would need it, as I hadn't had lunch.</p>

<p> The Sports and I started together. I got into third place, with one
Sport behind me. But they were fitter, and the last Sport rider passed
me soon after the start. So I was last of the people I'd started with.
It was a bit depressing being last. The thought crossed my mind that I
could drop out. But the riding was good, and if I quit I wouldn't get
my prize money. Besides, there was still a chance of passing one of
the Sport riders if she crashed or had mechanical trouble. So I kept
up the pace, riding on the edge of what I was capable of doing for an
extended period. On the fire road sections (which comprised maybe 1/3
of the course) I made sure I drank some, and I was glad I'd brought
Gatorade instead of just water.</p> 

<p> When I ride in Thetford Forest I occasionally lose control in
the singletrack. This is because the faster you go, the more fun it
is, so I'm usually pushing it. But then I'm also taking breaks and
recovering after these fast bits. In a race you keep going, so I soon
found that I was having no trouble at all in the singletrack. I was
too tired to go fast enough to whipe out. </p> 

<p> Into the second lap, I got passed by a bunch of fast guys -- the Haro
team, whom I'd seen warming up on wind trainers under the Haro
canopy. They must be the Pro/Elites... Every now and then one of the
other guys who started with that pack passed me. I got good at
listening for them, and when they got close I would pull a little ways
off the track and say "Go".</p> 

<p> Very close to the end I was passed by a Haro woman. Finally the finish
line was in sight. I put on all the speed I could muster as I crossed
the line, wanting to put on a good show for the finish. Simon and Tony
were there to greet me, having spent the intervening time riding
around at their own pace. Simon (who had timed me) said I'd done the
race in 1 hour, 15 minutes, 15 seconds. I was really beat, and after
getting off the bike I wanted to do nothing more than flop in the
grass. I did, and after a few seconds took off my helmet, since it put
my neck at a funny angle.</p> 

<p> Eventually I recovered enough to get up, and Tony bought us all some
tea from the nearby burger van. Talking to people at the race, I found
out that the womam who'd passed me just before the end, thus finishing
a minute or two before me, had started only five minutes after our
group, with the Pro/Elites. So in the entire race she had gained only
6 or 7 minutes on me!</p> 

<p> When all the riders were finished I collected my prize money (15
pounds, a 3 pound profit for the day) and we went home.</p> 

<p> Oh, here's a neat bit of trivia: the front wheel I was riding on is
one I had built myself (out of an XT hub, Mavic 217 rim, and DT double
butted stainless spokes, in a 3-cross pattern). Actually it is the
first wheel I've ever made, and this was its first off-road ride. In
fact the only riding I had done on it before the trip to Thetford was
to ride it to work (a round trip of 5 miles) to show it off. It served
me fine, being just as true after the ride/race as it was before. I
am very proud of it.</p>
