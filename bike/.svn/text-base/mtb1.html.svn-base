<h2>Newbie MTBer</h2>

<p> I got a mountain bike in January '96. This was one of my first rides.
The ride was on Saturday, 24 February. I wrote this the next day. </p>

<hr>

<p> Here in Philly we're having great weather this weekend -- sunny and in
the 50's & 60's both days. The only drawback is that it's quite windy.</p>

<p> On Thursday Daryl Doan, Penn Cycling Team MTB racer, announced that
there would be a trail work party at a local park (Wissahickon Creek)
on Saturday. Being that I now have a mountain bike, and hope to (when
trail conditions improve) be riding those trails, I figured that I'd go
and help.</p>

<p> I arrived at the proper time and place, and found only Daryl there. He
wondered where all the others were, until we realized that the trail
work parties are the 2nd Saturday of each month, not the last as he
had been thinking. Oh, well. But there we were with our bikes, so we
thought we might as well use them.</p>

<p> We went up to one of the trails to check its condition. It was damp
and a bit soft. We rode along it a little ways, doing a bit of work on
the water bars (rearranging rocks), before heading back down. The
descent was very rocky. I kept my weight low and back, and tried to
keep up a bit of speed so that if I hit a rock I'd go over it instead
of just stopping. I succeeded, though I was pretty scared.</p>

<p> Then we went to check out a trail that I knew of. It goes between the
river (Schuylkill) and a highway (Rte 76). I had seen the beginning of
it many times, riding around on my touring bike, and now that I had an
MTB I wanted to check it out. We rode over to the entrance and
started. It was fine at first, a wide gravel dirt road. Then it
narrowed and the surface changed to a bunch of small rocks. This was
still fine. Then we descended towards the river and went through a
section of river muck -- soft thick sandy river deposits.  I mostly
managed to keep going here by concentrating and pedaling hard.</p>

<p> Then Daryl started laughing. I looked ahead.  The river was high from
several days of light rain. It covered the path completely for a ways,
coming to the concrete wall the supported the highway. Oooops. Daryl
said, with an eager gleam in his eye, "I don't feel like going back.
I'd be tempted to wade across it". The current looked swift, and as it
was only a bit above 50F, I knew the water would be cold. I imagined
myself being swept down the river and succumbing to hypothermia. I
said "If you do it, I will".</p>

<p> So we did it. He started to ride across, but soon stopped and got off
the bike. "How's the water?" I asked. "Cold", he replied. Oh, well. I
picked up the bike and stepped in. It was cold. The water was only a
foot deep, so altho' is was moving fast, it wasn't dangerous, as there
were big flat rocks at the bottom providing good footing. My feet were
getting quite cold by the time I got across, but happily as soon as I
was out of the water they started to warm up again.</p>

<p> After this, the trail got worse. There were lots of big logs to lift
the bikes over and large patches of river muck. I felt proud of being
able to go over a log about 8" in diameter.  I didn't use fancy tricks
like bunny hopping, but I lifted then front wheel, kept pedaling, and
found that somehow my chainrings cleared the log. The back wheel
slipped a bit going over, but I made it. This is by far the biggest
thing I've gone over. Another (minor) accomplishment is that I forded
a couple small streams. On the other hand, I had my first MTB endo. I
was going down a steep section of river muck (going fast in this stuff
isn't an option) and hit a rock.  The bike stopped dead, and I went
over the bars and landed unceremoniously on a pile of racks. Luckily,
I landed on the flat surfaces; no points stuck into my ribs. I picked
myself and the bike up, shook us both off, and got going again.</p>

<p> By the time I got to the end of the trail, I was ready to take some
nice flat roads back home. Powering thru' river muck had left me
tired, and I had little aches in my elbow, knee, and ankle where I hit
the rocks. But I felt good. A pretty decent job for one of my first
times on the trails.</p>
