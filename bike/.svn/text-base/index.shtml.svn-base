<p> I'm very into cycling. It is one of my main hobbies and is my main
form of exercise. I ride to get to work and to go shopping, and I ride
on and off-road for fun when I can find the time. In the past I have
done alot of riding at night, and have had some fun putting together
lighting systems for doing so. Nowadays most of the time I ride I have
my kids with me, either on their own bikes or on the back of tandems
piloted by myself or my husband. Cycling always has been a part of my
life, and (as long as I am physically capable) it will continue to
be.</p>
