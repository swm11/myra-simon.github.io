Hmmmm, Myra quite likes her Thudbuster. You learn to cope with the
lack of damping. If you hit a big bump that you really weren't
expecting, you feel it compress, and then you lift your bum up
slightly to avoid the rebound getting you. Whereas without the sus
seatpost you'd just be hit by the saddle in the first place. If you
see the bump coming you raise your bum a bit and avoid the problem in
the first place.

So probably many of you are thinking, why bother if you've got to
stand anyway? Well the thing is that you only have to stand for the
big bumps. It absorbs the little bumps very well. It's especially
useful on regular bumps, like cobblestones (you know the ones along
the canal Matt?) or ruts with deep tractor treads in them. Those are
really annoying on a normal handtail since they are long enough
stretches that you need to pedal over them (can't just stand up and
coast), and I find pedalling sitting down much easier than standing
up. The Thudbuster allows me to sit down. And it feels like you're
floating on normal singletrack stuff.

Evidently some people are bothered by the fact that your bum goes back
a bit when the thing compresses (being a parallelogram linkage rather
than telescoping job, see http://www.lickbike.com/i0869200.htm), but I
simply don't notice.

And I'd like to try a day ride on a full-sus bike to see what it's
like!

Accoring to the mtb@cyclery.com, which is dominated by US posters, yes
it is. Many people said "The other seatposts offer you some shock
absorption, but only the Thudbuster gives you something that feels
like real suspension." 

According to an article by Max Mountain Bike, it isn't the best. They
didn't like the lack of damping and that fact that your bum moves back
as the thing compresses. They noted that the latter wasn't complained
about by people who had were used to full-sus bikes. They liked the
USE best, but on a recent discussion on uk.rec.cycling, the USE was
said to be not very durable, bolts kept breaking on it. The Kalloy
one was recommended as a very cheap way of trying out a susp seatpost.

Orbit are certainly impressed by the Thudbuster. Go to
	http://www.orbit-cycles.co.uk/index2.htm
and click on the orange box that says Thudbuster. There are lots of
postive review, and Orbit says "The Thudbuster is available as an
option on most of our models, and as an accessory for road and
off-road riders.

In summary, if you decide "damn the expense I want the best" I'd
recommend the Thudbuster, but it's a bit difficult to get over
here. You could try to get one from Orbit and see how that goes. I got
mine from the States, a place called Lickton's. It's a good shop,
especially if you're a roadie as well as MTBer, and they're happy to
ship overseas.
