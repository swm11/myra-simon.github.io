<p> I'm very into cycling. It is one of my main hobbies and is my main
form of exercise. I ride to get to work and to go shopping, and I ride
on and off-road for fun when I can find the time. I like riding at
night, and have had some fun putting together lighting systems for
doing so. Nowadays most of the time I ride I have my kids with me: my
daughter rides her own bike, and my son goes on the back of our
childback tandem. Cycling always has been a part of my life, and (as
long as I am physically capable) it will always be a part of my
life.</p>
