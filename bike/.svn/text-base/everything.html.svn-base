<h1>Everything I need to know I learned from my bikes</a></h1>

<blockquote>

<p> The title of this article is partly a joke, but the fact is that
each bike has taught me a great deal, or I have learned alot through
riding it and modifying it.</p>

<p> I had quite a few one-speed bikes before buying my first
multi-gear bike. These taught me the joy of riding, of going
significant distances under my own power. </p>

<p> My old Schwinn LeTour taught me how useful gears could be, and
that derailleurs aren't so hard to maintain. Of course, it didn't have
indexed shifting, so I didn't have to do much to it to keep it
working. Going for a tour with it, I learned that it really does get
cold at night even in the summer (I was foolish enough to try to do
without a sleeping bag for that trip), and that putting all your stuff
in rear panniers and rack-top bag is a pretty bad way of carrying a
heavy load. It left my company long ago, being replaced by the
Panasonic PT3500. </p>

<p> My Panasonic PT3500 touring bike (bought in 1988, still in use in
one form or another) has taught me an incredible amount. I learned
that index shifting is a wonderful thing. That cantilever brakes are
much stronger than centerpulls (I assumed from this that cantis were
stronger than any road brake). I learned from touring with it that
distributing weight between rear and front panniers (the latter on a
lowrider rack) works much better for carrying loads. I also learned
that with a flexy laden bike you must shift down when you stop, since
you can't stand up to pedal! I learned from trying to ride it offroad
that slick tires don't have much grip in steep dirt, and later from
putting cyclocross tires on it that it works pretty well offroad in
flattish areas, except that the narrow drop bars don't offer you as
good a hand position for rough stuff as flat bars. It is has now been
converted to a <a href="fixed.html">fixed gear</a> so it has taught me
about riding without a freewheel. </p>

<p> My mountain bike (heavily upgraded Trek 950) has taught me the
joys of offroad riding, of getting away from the cars into the quiet
contryside, and of challenging myself with technical bits.
Surprisingly, I'm pretty good at trail skills, although I'm hopeless
at showoff type skills. From putting a suspension fork and seatpost on
it I've learned the value of springs. From getting it absolutely caked
in mud I've learned the value of narrow tires for muddy
conditions. </p>

<p> My cheap used racer (Paul Milnes) came with 165mm Stronglight
cranks. This was a big shock to me. It felt so strange that at first I
contemplating finding some 170mm cranks to put on it, but gradually I
realized that it was actually better for me: I could spin the pedals
much more easily. And then I started converting all my bikes to 165mm
cranks... I also learned, in looking for some better brakes to put on
in place of the cheapo sidepulls that came on it, that dual pivot
brakes are as powerful as cantis, and are much easier to adjust. It
was sold off in autumn '99 and now provides a trusty ride for another
local lady. </p>

<p> From my Fisher (old alu MTB) I learned to appreciate a more
upright riding position. You see, all of my bikes were meant for men
and offered a very stretched out riding position. I'd been suffering
from tendonitis in my elbows for a few years, and in desperation I
kitted out the Fisher for on-road riding, putting on slick tires and
mudguards. Suddenly, I could ride as far as I wanted to without my
elbows bothering me. This has lead me to think much more about how
women fit on bikes. I've also discovered how nice it is to have a
"road" bike that's reasonably comfortable offroad, so I can mix
offroad into my road rides. </p>

<p> From my old 3-speed, I've discovered the joys of long-lasting
bikes. It's 30 years old, and works as well as it did when new (I
guess, I've never ridden a new three-speed!). </p>
