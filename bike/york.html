<h1> Rough Stuff in the Moors </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Way back in November, Matt told me about this "Rough Stuff" ride he
was going to be leading in June. He said "It's part of the York Cycle
Rally. It's 75 miles, about 1/3 off road, and includes some really
tough going". I thought: a good challenge. So I said I'd do it if I
could. </p>

<p> June rolls around and I've been doing a fair bit of off-road riding.
I make plans to go to the cycle rally. Two days before the ride Matt
phones me up and says he's injured his knee and can't lead the
ride. However he says he'll mail maps to Andy (a mutual friend) with
the route highlighted, along with a written description of the
turns. Ok, I'm still up for it... </p>

<p> It's 8:30am Saturday, the start time of the ride. There's a bit of
confusion about the start location: there are usually signs up where
people are supposed to meet, but Matt's sign has been taken down since
the organizers thought the ride was cancelled. Only four people show
up: the three who'd told Matt that they'd do it (me, Andy, and Dave)
and a guy named Kevin. Dave and Kevin are two quite muscular guys on
hardtail MTBs. Andy is a skinny guy on a road bike with two
chainrings, full fenders, and touring slicks. I have my touring bike
with triple chainrings, MTB mudguards, and cyclocross tires. Probably
more would have joined if we hadn't had the messup over starting. </p>

<p> We ride out of York uneventfully. Andy knows the start of the ride,
but he has to stop to check the map every now and then once we get
some distance from York, and especially on the off-road bits. </p>

<p> The first couple of off-road sections aren't too bad. They include
some plain dirt track as well as tracks that have plenty of foliage
(including nettles) along them. It turns out that Dave is mildy
allergic to nettles, and his skin looks red immediately after our
encounters with them. Later, his skin swells up and gets blotchy and
bumpy. </p>

<p> On one of these stretches is a pretty steep hill, and going up this
the three guys stick together, and I fall back, being not as fit as
they are. This pattern is repeated through the entire ride! </p>

<p> At one point we hit a horrible muddy section, made far worse by
4-wheel drive vehicles than it would be on its own. With plenty of
experience at muddy riding I'm doing well for awhile, but eventually
all of us just get off and walk. Finally we come out and spend a bit
of time trying to get the worst mud off our derailleurs and brakes.
Then we go along some roads to get to our first food stop of the day,
which we really need. It's a tea shop, and they let us come in and
eat, even looking muddy and smelling bad... This is about the 23 mile
point. </p>

<p> Then we climb up onto the moors. The moors are large open spaces of
land, with no trees, only lots and lots of heather, and some vicious
decents and climbs surrounding the valleys. We go up it gradually, and
I don't fall too far behind the guys. Once at the top, there's this
gently rising and falling dirt road, with lots of ruts, that we ride
along. Along one section of it they've dumped some soft dirt/rock
mixture, I suppose in an effort to combat erosion, and I'm expanding
huge amounts of energy to go 3mph on the flat. I think, I could walk
just as fast and it would be lots easier. But they're riding, so I
keep it up. Finally they get off and walk, so I happily get off too.
When the yukky loose dirt section ends we all ride again. </p>

<p> Then there's a series of steep ups and downs. It's all a blur to me, I
don't remember what followed what. There are a couple of really
difficult (technical and steep) descents, some rideable decents, a bit
of road, a very steep path up a grass slope, one short steep technical
uphill. Dave and Kevin, who are riding MTBs, do better on the descents
than Andy and I do, but Andy is doing amazingly well, considering he
is on a road bike and not at all used to off-road riding. He is just
incredibly fit. Some parts of it all of us walk. The guys continue to
wait for me at the top of climbs, not only long enough for me to
rejoin them but also for me to catch my breath again. </p>

<p> At the top of one particularly steep and long climb I get to the top
to find the guys stretched out in the grass. They suggest I do the
same. I do. When I get up I try to take a drink, and I discover that
my water pack is empty. Ooops. Kevin reports the same problem. We are
about to join a road, and there's a farm right there. So Kevin and I
go to the house to ask for some water, which the lady inside is happy
to give us. </p>

<p> After another down and up, or two, we are at the top. Finally. We look
around a bit. Then we coast down a very long, not too steep off-road
downhill, then on a very long not too steep on-road downhill (with one
little climb) and then we're in Kirbymoorside, a village on the edge
of the moors. This is the 51 mile point. We get food from a shop and
sit on the curb eating it. I must say, I'd be very happy to end the
ride right here. We've done the longish ride to get to the moors, and
we've done a challenging loop in the moors. I'm very tired and ready
for a hot shower. </p>

<p> But there are 24 miles of road left to get back to York! It is mostly
flat, but there are a few annoying climbs. I really drag. I'm in all
sorts of pain, but I keep going. The guys wait for me at the tops of
the hills, and I draft them on the flats. </p>

<p> After what seems like forever we are finally back in York. Yay! I'm
aching all over, and I feel bad about holding the guys up so much on
the hills, but I did it. </p>

<p> Stats: 75 miles, 9.5 hours including all the stops. I don't know the
elevation gain; I'm going to buy myself an altimeter! </p>
