<h1>Avocet Cyclocomputers</h1>

<p> I've had 
<a href="http://www.avocet.com/cyclopages/cyclo.html">
Avocet cyclocomputers</a> since 1988. I lost the first one
(Avocet 20), broke the second one (an Avocet 30; I dropped it on a
cement floor, and after that the speedometer readings were way off --
to be honest I'm surprised that that did it in, since I've abused all
my other ones without bad side effects). The third one (Avocet 31)
I've had for um, maybe 4 years, and it still works fine. Last year I
got an Avocet 45tt which I really like: it's nice to know what my
cadence is. It's all scratched up now, since I forgot to take it off
the last time I turned the bike upside down on the cement floor of the
garage, but it still works fine. I've ordered an Avocet 35 for the
third bike; they all have different tire sizes, and I'm too lazy to
reprogram them.</p>

<p> I really like the feel of the buttons, the nice click they give you.
The front mounts are very simple and work well. The magnet attached to
the hub has no alignment problems. The rear mount is a bit more of a
pain because it's one more thing in the way when you're putting the
rear wheel in, but I keep hoping that someday I'll find a way to put
the rear wheel in flawlessly, getting the chain in just the right
place, not knocking the bike computer sensor out of the way, etc...
</p>

<p> As far as waterproofness, sometimes after riding in the rain the
window gets fogged up, but they still work fine, and eventually they
dry out.</p>
