<h1> Bicycle cranks: Check your Cranks!</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> I've been cycling all my life, riding to my friends' houses when I
was a kid, doing 20-odd mile rides as a teenager, and just kept going
from there. From the time I was a teenager until I was in my
30's I had only ever used standard length (170mm) cranks. Then I
bought a cheap racer, which happened to come with 165mm cranks. When I
first tried to ride it I found it very weird.  Part of it was that it
was set up completely differently from my old reliable tourer. But
part of it was the noticeably shorter cranks. Over time I adjusted it,
replaced parts, etc, until it suited me. But the smaller cranks
remained very different in feel. At first they felt so strange to me
that I wanted to replace them. I was used to making bigger circles
with my feet, and with the shorter cranks, my feet were suddenly
constrained into a smaller radius and they turned much more quickly
than I was expecting. Not that the circle was vastly smaller, only
5mm per leg! But it felt very different. </p>

<p> Gradually, however, I found that the smaller circles were better
for me. The pedals were so much easier to spin around. Oddly enough,
it seemed of most benefit on hills, allowing me to keep up my pedal
speed much better. The shorter cranks won me over, and over time I
have put 165mm cranks on almost all my bikes. Replacing perfectly good
cranks may seem unjustifiably expensive, but I am serious about my
cycling.  The difference is enough to make it worth the money. </p>

<p> My pedalling was improved significantly by getting cranks that
were only 5mm different from the ones I was using. If you're extra
tall or extra short and are using 170mm cranks, your ideal crank
length is probably 10mm or more different from your current cranks. If
you swap to the right size, the improvement is likely to be great. </p>

<p> Manufacturers put the same length of cranks on all bikes because
it's cheaper, not because it's the right thing for the rider. They get
away with it because most people haven't tried different length
cranks; many don't even realize that cranks come in different
lengths. </p>

<p> Propelling a bike forward involves turning pedals around in a
circle. For maximum efficiency, and minimum impact on the body, the
diameter of the circle should be in proportion to the length of your
legs. The leg is strongest at pushing when it is closest to being
straight. If the cranks are too long the circle is too big for your
legs, your knee will be bent too much at top part of the stroke, and
you won't be able to put as much power into the upper part of the
stroke. This will prevent you from spinning the pedals as fast, and
will also put more stress on your knees. If you have long legs you can
make a bigger circle with your feet and still keep your legs in the
high power zone, and you won't have your knees too bent. If your
cranks are too short for you, you won't be able to apply as much
torque with them as you could with longer cranks. </p>

<p> There are two major ways to find a good crank length. The first is
simply to measure your leg length and then use a chart.  Measuring
your leg length is easy. Take a big book and push it up into your
crotch as you're standing against a wall. Make sure the back edge of
the book is flat against the wall. Mark the wall at the top of the
book (at the arrow in the diagram) and measure to the floor. This is
your leg length. (Many cycling people call this measurement your
inseam, but since this conflicts with a tailer's use of inseam, which
is crotch to ankle bone, I'll just call is leg length to avoid
confusion.) The chart to the right of the diagram relates leg length
to crank lengths. The chart is provided by TA, who are one of the few
companies that make cranks with a wide range of lengths.
</p>

<p> The second method is to take your leg length (leg length in cm as
measured above) and multiply by a constant factor to get your crank
length in mm. The constant factor should be somewhere between 2.0 and
2.16 (the latter is the one recommended by <a
href="http://www.nettally.com/palmk/crankset.html"> Kirby
Palm</a>). Chris Juden of the CTC has a different method for finding
leg length. He measures height to top of head when sitting on the
floor and subtracts that from standing height (no shoes). He finds
this produces a more reliable method than the "book between the legs"
method described above.  Yet another variation is suggested by <a
href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fitting.htm">Peter White</a>, a
framebuilder in the US. He measures the length of the leg, from top of
femur to floor, in cm, and multiplies this by 1.85, to get the crank
length in mm.  Finding the top of the femur is the hard part. Feel
along the outside of your hip to find the place where your leg joins
the hip. The top of the femur is slightly above the actual joint, so
if you lift your leg, the top of the femur will move back
slightly. Search for this movement.
</p>

<p> Now, these methods above yield somewhat different lengths. The
chart suggests a smaller range in crank lengths than the linear method
(i.e. the linear method suggests even longer cranks for taller people,
and even shorter cranks for shorter people). Of course, the chart is
provided by TA and you can say that they made up the chart so that it
showed that the lengths of cranks they make covers all adults. </p>

<p> Even so, the chart isn't so far off for tall people (e.g. 94cm
legs yields 185mm cranks on the chart, but 188mm cranks using a
multiplier of 2.0) but there are large discrepancies for small people
(68cm legs yields 155mm on the chart, but 147mm using a multiplier of
2.16). I think the main thing that this suggests is that the TA chart,
which at first glance seems so radical in suggesting either very long
or very short cranks, is in fact on the conservative side, and that
short people especially might consider getting even shorter cranks
than those recommended by the chart.  </p>

<p> If you try out a bike with the "ideal" crank length, you may find
that you hate it. I would recommend that you stick with it, based on
my own experience of first hating and then loving 165mm cranks. </p>

<h3>Special considerations</h3>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4>Fudge factors</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The length you'll end up with above is the ideal crank length for
general road riding: racing and training. However, depending on the
situation, you may want a crank length longer or shorter than this. In
racing, you want a relatively high cadence in order to be able to be
able to follow breakaways and maintain a high power output while not
overly tiring your mucles or joints (see <a
href="cadence.html">Optimum Cadence</a>). In training you want to
practice high cadence work to get ready for races. </p>

<p> In mountain biking, spinning seems less important. MTB races and
rides usually don't involve much sprinting, and usually aren't very
long, so a lower cadence that optimizes oxygen usage is preferred.
Because of this, many people prefer to have longer cranks for MTBing.
Adding 5mm to the crank length can give extra leverage without
hampering the spin too much. </p>

<p> Similarly, in time trialling you may want a longer crank, since
your cadence will generally be lower. I've heard 2.5mm suggested as a
possible increment. </p>

<p> Touring is not an intense exercise so you don't tend to spin as
fast as your would while training. In addition you can end up climbing
very steep long hills, so you may want to consider somewhat longer
cranks for touring. On the other hand, you'll be riding for many hours
in a day, day after day, and thus you want to take good care of your
knees, so make sure you don't overdo the length. </p>

<p> In contrast, in track riding, you have a fixed gear, so speed is
in large part down to how fast you can spin. Also, hitting a pedal on
the floor becomes a real possibility. Thus shorter cranks are
generally used for track racing. You may think of trying 2.5 to 5mm
less for this use.  Shorter cranks are often used on fixed gear road
riding as well, both to allow you to spin faster and to go around
corners without hitting your pedal against the ground. </p>

<h4>Different length legs</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Some people have legs of significantly different lengths. This may
be something they've had since birth, or it may the the result of an
accident (say, a badly broken leg). If you can manage to measure the
length of your legs, you can use one of the methods above to calculate
the crank length that would work for each leg. I would say that if
this length is 2.5mm or less, I wouldn't worry about it, just get two
cranks of the same length. If the difference is larger, then getting
two different length cranks could improve your cycling quite a
bit. Buying two sets of cranks to get left and right a different size
may well be prohibitively expensive. This is where a custom crank
maker comes in. See the bottom of this page for some sources. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Kids</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Women, especially shorter ones, can have difficulty finding cranks
that fit. The problem is far worse for kids, especially when their
parents put them on adult bikes (with 170mm cranks!) as soon as their
feet reach the pedals with the saddle is at its lowest height. This
results in their legs being extremely bent when the pedal is at the
top of the stroke, which surely can't be good for growing legs. </p>

<p>There are a few solutions to this problem. For smaller kids the
best solution is a proper kid's bike, like those made by <a
href="http://www.islabikes.co.uk">Islabikes</a>. For older kids and
teenagers, one option is to buy a small-sized adult bike and get
shorter cranks for it. My officemate did this, getting <a
href="http://www.highpath.net">Highpath Engineering<a> to shorten some
budget cranks to a sensible length. </p>

<p> Kids on the back of tandems have a particular problem. Often
tandems have quite small rear sections, so it's tempting to take your
kid on the back of the tandem as soon as he/she can reach the
pedals. Replacing tandem cranks is even more expensive than replacing
regular cranks, but it's essential if you want to keep your kids'
knees in good shape. <a href="http://www.sjscycles.co.uk/">St John St
Cycles</a> make some super kid-sized cranks for the backs of tandems:
they have holes drilled at 115 and 140mm. Alternatively, at least one
custom crank maker, Heiko Brechtel of <a
href="http://www.customcranks.de/en/">customcranks.de</a>, does double
drilled tandem rear cranks in whatever lengths you want. </p>

<p> You can get kids on tandems even earlier, if you get a childback
tandem, which has a very small back seating area. However, be warned
that many tandems that are promoted as childback still have 170mm
cranks in the back, which are completely unsuitable for children! In
fact, the only tandems that I've found that are available with shorter
cranks are the childback versions of Thorn tandems, and even then you
have to pay a bit extra. (At time of writing, the double-drilled
cranks mentioned above are a £40 extra. This is an upgrade that is
well worth it!) Please, parents, if you get one of these "childback"
tandems with the adult-sized cranks on back, for the sake of your
kids' knees, replace them or get them shortened. </p>

<p> As an alternative to buying completely different cranks for your
kids' bikes, crank shorteners can also be used, both for tandems and
regular bikes. These bolt on to the existing cranks to add pedal holes
at much shorter lengths. You can get some from <a
href="http://www.sjscycles.co.uk/">St John St Cycles</a>. </p>

<h3>So you think this is completely bogus?</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> I seem to have a running argument with some bike manufacturers and
bike shop employees, who try to justify the one size fits all approach
to cranks (170mm for road, 175mm for off-road). To back up my
suggestion that crank length should be proportional to leng length,
have a good look at Kirby Palm's <a
href="http://www.nettally.com/palmk/crankset.html">article on
cranks</a>. This debunks all the usual objections against proportional
length cranks. Note that the multiplier that he recommends is on the
large side, but it still results in much shorter cranks for short
people than they usually use. </p>

<p> Of course, I've already mentioned a couple of other people who
believe in proportional length cranks. They are <a
href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fitting.htm">Peter White</a>
and <a href="petitest.html#cranks">Chris Juden</a>. </p>

<h3>Where to find different length cranks (US and UK)</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> It can sometimes be quite a challenge to find cranks that actually
fit you. The following paragraphs are meant to be only a rough guide
of where you might begin your search. I make no efforts to be
comprehensive. </p>

<p> <a href="http://cycle.shimano-eu.com/"> Shimano</a> can be a good
place to start. The most expensive groupsets have the best chioce of
crank lengths, which is why I have Deore XT cranks on my mountain
bike: none of the lower ranges offered a 165mm crank length. Check the
website to see what lengths are available. You probably won't find all
sizes in your local shop, but you can get your shop to order them from
the distributer. If you are not in the US, this may not be an option,
as not all of the range is imported to UK. However, you can contact a
bike shop in the States (like <a
href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/">Peter White
Cycles</a> or <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/index.html">
Harris Cyclery</a>) and get them to order the chainset and ship it
over to you. </p>

<p> The following paragraphs describe cranks that are available in the
UK.  With the exception of TA cranks they can be hard if not
impossible to get in the US.  If you are in the US and want to get one
of these cranksets, try contacting the UK bike shops to see if they
will ship it over to the States. To give you an idea of cost, St John
St Cycles say that shipping for a crankset would be about 15
pounds. </p>

<p> TA chainsets (made in France) are often the first to come to mind
when people think of odd-sized chainsets. The best info I've found on
TA chainsets is provided by <a
href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/">Peter White Cycles</a>. TA
chainsets end up being very pricy, but they have a huge selection of
crank lengths, and they are compatible with (at least some of) Campag
and Shimano road groupsets. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.sjscycles.co.uk/">St John St Cycles</a> do their
own Thorn cranks, which are available in a huge range of lengths. They
are meant for touring bikes and tandems, not road bikes, having 110/70
bolt circle diameters. But let's be honest, road bike gearing (with a
52 or 53 tooth large chainring) is too high for the vast majority of
cyclists anyway. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.robertscycles.com/">Roberts Cycles</a> does
not make cranks, but they do specialize in custom bikes for women, so
they usually have a selection of short cranks in stock. Contact them for
more info. </p>

<p> If you really can't find what you need in manufactured cranks, you
may need to get them custom made. As I mentioned above, custom cranks
are about the only option if your legs have quite different
lengths. The only two custom crank makes I know of are Heiko Brechtel
of <a href="http://www.customcranks.de/en/">customcranks.de</a> and
Lennard Zinn of <a href="http://www.zinncycles.com">Zinn Cycles</a>,
but there are probably more. </a>

<p> Finally, you can get cranks shortened, either by bolting on bits
to cranks, or by drilling and tapping holes in them.  You can get the
bolt-on crank shorteners from <a href="http://www.sjscycles.co.uk/">St
John St Cycles</a>. They are not recommended as a solution for an
adult, but as a way to accommodate the changing needs of growing
kids. Permanent crank shortening (via drilling) is offered both by St
John St Cycles and <a href="http://www.highpath.net">Highpath
Engineering<a>. </p>
