<h1> What to look for in a women's bike </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This is meant to be a guide for the sort of things you should look
for if you're buying a bike for a woman, whether it's a "women's
specific bike" or not. It covers all kinds of bikes, whether for
on-road or off-road use. </p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Frame Size and Design</h2>

<blockquote>

</p> This is the most important part of buying a bike, as the frame is
the heart of the bike. Since it's a big and complicated topic, I've
made an article that addresses only this issue, <a
href="womens-fit.html">Buying a bike that fits a woman</a>.

</blockquote>

<h2>Bars and Stems</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the main concerns for women is getting the bars closer to
them. This can be achieved by both getting the bars futher back (via a
shorter stem) and higher up. Getting the bars higher can be
accomplished by getting a stem that has an upward slope in the
extension part (an old-fashioned quill stem consistes of two parts,
the quill that goes down into the steerer tube, and the extension that
goes forward and grips your bars; if you have a threadless stem, the
entire length of the stem is the extension), getting a stem with a
longer quill (if you use a quill stem) or getting a longer steerer
tube on your fork (if you have a threadless stem). For information on
stems and bars that help with this, see <a href="bodge.html">Bodge
Your Bike to Fit</a>. </p>

<p> You should also consider the width of your handelbars. For both
road and mountain bikes, the width of the handelbars should have some
relation to the width of your shoulders. Since women generally have
narrower shoulders than men, they shouldn't have the same width
bars. I'm 5'5" (medium height for a woman) and I get along pretty well
with 23" to 24" MTB bars, and this is using bar ends, which moves the
grips in a bit. Many MTB magazines will complain if a bike has bars
that are "only" 24" wide, and praise bikes with substantially wider
bars. Remember that the reviewers are exclusively men (unless they're
reviewing a women's specific bike), so take their comments with a
grain of salt. Also keep in mind that I like 24" bars for real
technical off-road riding, where wide bars are very useful for
meneuvering the bike around tricky bits of track. When I use flat bars
on the road, I prefer them narrower. My commuter bike (essentially a
hybrid) has 21" bars, which I find perfect. However, before you cut
your bars this short, make sure you can fit everything you want on
your bars. My commuter bike is a fixed gear, so I didn't have to leave
space for shifters! </p>

<p> Many MTBers use "riser bars", handlebars which bend upwards and
back a bit away from the stem area. They can be useful for raising the
grips up if you can't get the hand position up high enough otherwise,
but they have a problem for women: they are usually significantly
wider than flat bars. This means that you can end up with bars that
are far too wide for you, and you really can't cut off the ends of
them, because they curve at the wrong place, preventing from moving
your shift and brake levers far enough in. One handlebar which offers
quite a bit of rise, but is not too wide is the Juliana handlebar,
made by <a href="http://www.wylder.com/about.htm">Wylder</a>.  It also
has a narrower grip area, allowing you to use grips that are either
much thinner, or much better padded, than standard grips. However,
this thinner grip area prevents you from using bars ends or SRAM
twist-shift levers, so if you like these things, you'll have to look
elsewhere for a solution. </p>

<p> For road bikes, I find that I am comfy with road bike
bars that are 40cm wide (center to center). I think this is wider than
the bars many women of my size use, perhaps because I do alot of
MTBing. I also like bars that have a short reach and shallow drop,
like the Morphe bars mentioned in <a href="bodge.html">Bodge
Your Bike to Fit</a>. </p>

<p> Another drop handlebar that is very useful is the Terry handlebar,
which has indentations to put your hands closer to the brake levers
when your hands are on the drops. This is especially useful if you
want to use Shimano or Campagnolo integrated shifter/brake
levers. These levers put the brake lever even further from the bar
than the usual drop bar brake lever, making them more difficult to use
from the drops with small hands. I do have quite small hands and have
difficuly reaching plain brake levers, and even worse problems
reaching integrated shift/brake levers from the drops. </p>

<h2>Brake Levers</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> First, see Chris Juden's comments on <a
href="pt-bits.html#blevers">brake levers</a>. Note that Dia Compe make
short-reach brake levers (the BL-24C) for drop bars, but these tends
to have more cable friction than brake levers from Campagnolo and
Shimano, which compounds the problem that women often have a weaker
grip than men. Magura make hydralic rim brakes that with drop bars,
which, as Chris points out, help by reducing losses from cable
friction and stretching. </p>

<p> Despite the difficulties of reaching the brakes/shifters from the
drops, many women still prefer to use Shimano or Campagnolo integrated
brake/shift levers because of the convenience of operating them from
the brake lever hoods. If you have small hands and want to use these
levers, consider getting the Terry handlebars mentioned above. Another
thing to consider is that Shimano Sora shift/brake levers have an
adjustment screw that brings the levers closer to the bars, which can
help. I find that Campagnolo and Shimano shifter/brake lever
combination equally easy to use while riding with my hands on the
brake lever hoods, and equally difficult to use while riding on the
drops. However, the Campag levers are wider when you're riding on the
hoods, and some women who have very small hands find the Campag levers
pinch nerves in the gap between their thumb and forefinger. </p>

<p> For MTB brake levers, there's little problem, as long as you take
advantage of the reach adjustment screw found on your MTB brake
levers. Setting these up properly makes it much easier to reach the
brake levers. </p>

<h2>Saddles</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> The place where "women's specific" bits most often show up is in
the saddle. However, there is by no means any agreement about what
makes an appropriate saddle for a woman. Maybe women find they don't
get on with women's saddles at all, and I'm one of these. See my
article <a href="saddles.html">Bike Saddles</a> for some suggestions,
and see Chirs Juden's comments <a
href="pt-bits.html#saddles">here</a>. </p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Cranks</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> Another very important feature to look for are crank lengths that
suit the length of the rider's leg. Some women are quite short, and
yet most manufacturers expect them to use the same crank lengths as
tall guys, or at best they put 175mm cranks on big bikes and 170mm
cranks on small bikes. This is only a 3% difference, for an entire
line of bikes with typical sizes for MTBs 16" to 22" (a 38%
difference) and for road bikes 49cm to 62cm (a 27% difference). In
fact the big bikes ought to have much longer cranks and the smaller
ones shorter cranks. See <a href="cranks.html">Check your Cranks!</a>
for more info. </p>
