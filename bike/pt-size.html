<h2>What Size?</h2>

<p> By Chris Juden. This accompanies the <a
href="petitest.html">Petite Bike Test</a> article.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This test has given me the opportunity to check a few theories
of mine about how to fit bicycles to people. There are quite a lot of
formulae around, published in various books etc, but few of them
attempt to deal with the extremes. And as I've said before: they seem
a bit too keen to fit people whatever equipment happens to be on the
shelf in most shops, rather than empowering the customer to demand
that something different be ordered.</p>

<p> &#9;The first problem is to measure yourself. Of course I had to ask
all the petite test riders to do this, and although I'm sure they
really tried to get it right, I'm afraid that their measurements did
not correspond very well with the bikes they found most
comfortable. Fortunately I had set up a visit to our Castleton base
from Martin Series, who represents the Bioracer fitting system in the
UK. A number of shops up and down the country have one of these
systems, with which you can be accurately measured and then have a
frame of whatever type you require - time-trialing, ATB or tourer
etc. - designed for you by an 'expert system' computer program. The
frame can either be built by Bioracer in Holland or to their pattern
by a local framebuilder.</p>

<p> &#9;Anyway, with a view to finding out what their system would
prescribe for our little lot, Martin brought along his mobile rider
measuring system and made a set of measurements. I'm afraid I can't
yet tell you what the computer has made of them (perhaps we've broken
it!) but I can tell you that these measurements look a lot more
consistent than the self-measuremnts. </p>

<p> &#9;Surprisingly, the most error-prone figure was the apparently
simple measurement of inside leg, which was under-estimated by as much
as 4cm. This also threw out the torso length - arm length was
generally quite accurately measured. In order to remove the
uncertainty (<I>and</I> the discomfort!) from this measurement I
propose the following method - you'll need a helper.</P>

<p><b>1</B>&#9;Stand in bare feet on a hard floor, back to the wall,
and get someone to measure your height: <B>H</B> by marking the wall
using a large book or LP record etc placed vertically on your head and
against the wall.</P>

<p><b>2</B>&#9;Turn to face the wall and measure the height <B>T</B>
to the top of your sternum by a similar method. The sternum is the
breast-bone. The ends of your collar bones almost meet on top of it,
making a little notch into which you can fit the corner of the LP
etc.</P>

<p><b>3</B>&#9;With your arm down by your side, make a fist - fingers
inwards so that the back of your hand is in line with the arm - and
have your helper measure your arm length <B>A</B> from the
middle-finger knuckle up to the acromion. This is a fancy name for the
bony tip of the shoulder.</P>

<p><b>4</B>&#9;Now sit on the floor with your back to the wall and
have your sitting height <B>S</B> measured.</P>

<p><b>Leg</B> <B>length</B> <B>L</B> <B>=</B> <B>H</B> <B>-</B>
<B>S</B>. This gives a leg length about 2cm greater than the maximum
found by other measuring methods, e.g. the Bioracer, but anyone can
thus obtain consistent results without special equipment. <B>L</B>
equals the maximum height of frame (<B>HT</B>) you will be physically
able to stand over, but a frame this high would be inconvenient and
sometimes painful to use. The maximum I would recommend for a road
touring bike is: <B>HT</B> <B>=</B> <B>L</B> <B>-</B> <B>5</B>
(cm). <BR>

&#9;Frame height isn't the same as the commonly quoted frame
<I>size</I>, which unfortunately is a very poor guide to the actual
size of person a frame might fit - since the size that is right for
you depends very much upon what kind of bike it is. Very
approximately, touring frames are usually about 25 to 28cm less than
<B>L</B>, ATBs another 5 to 10cm smaller still.<BR>

&#9;We've already established that crank length should be between 20%
and 21% of <B>L</B> - keeping towards the lower figure if you've got
dodgy knees or the higher one for big feet.</P>

<p><b>Body</B> <B>length</B> <B>B</B> <B>=</B> <B>T</B> <B>-</B>
<B>L</B> and arm length <B>A</B> we already have. I add these two
together to give a combined arm and body length <B>C</B>. This can be
used as an approximate guide to the optimum reach (<B>RE</B>) measured
horizontally between the centres of handlebar and seatpin. My advice
for a touring bike with dropped handlebars is: <B>RE</B> <B>=</B>
<B>C</B> <B>x</B> <B>P</B> where <B>P</B> is between 50% and 52% for
women and 51% to 53% for men. If flat (ATB-style) handlebars are used
then <B>P</B> should be increased by about 5%. </p>

<p> &#9;I'm afraid I can't be more precise than that. Suffice to say that
less flexible riders (especially those with back problems) who like to
have their handlebars level with or higher than the saddle should use
the lower figure to calculate reach; while those who prefer and are
physically able to adopt a more streamlined position, with the bars
significantly lower than the saddle, may use the higher
percentage. Seat-tube angle and the type of seatpin used - where it
places the saddle: behind, on or in front of its centreline - has an
influence upon where exactly you sit and affects reach.</p>

<p> &#9;To measure the reach of your own bike, first measure how far your
handlebars are above the ground (at the level of the centre of the bar
where it goes through the stem) and make a mark on the front of your
seatpin at the same height - raise the saddle if necessary so as to
expose a bare section of seatpin. Measure from the back of the bar
(close by the stem) to the mark on the front of the seatpin, and add
27mm.</p>

<p> &#9;The difference between <B>A</B> and <B>B</B> has a bearing
upon handlebar height for riders who seek the most eficient riding
position. <B>A</B> is usually greater than <B>B</B>, and placing the
bars below the saddle by a distance approximating to <B>½(A</B>
<B>-</B> <B>B)</B> seems to be about right. </P>

<P>Remember what I said about frame fitting formulae. They are nothing
more than an approximate guide: somewhere to start from if buying a
first bike or an indication of the direction in which to start
changing things if you're not happy with your current riding
position. If you <I>are</I> happy with a riding position nothing like
that given by these formulae: don't worry. If you've got used to it
and it works that's all that matters.</P>
