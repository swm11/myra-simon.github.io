<h1>Foot and Knee Pain</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Knee pain can have a variety of causes. Perhaps the most common
cause is doing too much too fast, like attacking hills too hard or
doing long rides without building up to them properly. Another common
problem is riding around with the saddle the wrong height, often too
low. </p>

<p> Among seasoned cyclists a common cause is associated with the <a
href="http://www.itbs.info/">iliotibial band</a>. Yet another problem
is misaligned cleats, if you have clipless pedals. In my case it was
none of these: it was caused by problems with the arches in my feet. A
few other people have mentioned this problem as well. If your feet
hurt as well as your knees, this may your problem. Here's my
story. </p>

<p> In summer 1997 I found my knees hurting a great deal. It was
worsened by cycling, or bending down to do gardening. It got so bad
that occasionally I'd have to go up stairs helping myself by holding
on the rails. At the suggestion of a friend, I figured I'd try putting
some arch supports into my shoes.  I went to the local drugstore and
bought some Orthaheel inserts, and in a few hours my knees felt better
(it took the edge off the pain) and after a few days they were feeling
good. </p>

<p> Now I use two kinds of insoles: Orthaheels for regular shoes, and
Superfeet for hiking boots and cycling shoes. Also, Birkenstock
sandals have amazing arch support, so if you want to wear sandals and
think that wearing inserts with sandals would look stupid, they are
the thing for you. Warning: Birkenstock lookalikes don't seem to have
as much arch support (at least among the ones I've seen) so accept no
substitutes. </p>

<p> I got the Orthaheels from a drug store. They are very expensive here
in England (20 pounds, roughly 32 dollars) but they are made in the US
so they should be much much cheaper there if you can find them. They
are great for shoes that don't come with insoles: they go under the
back half of your foot and give you wonderful arch support. </p>

<p> The Superfeet are full length insoles, and they are for shoes that
come with insoles. You take out the insoles that come with the shoes
and put in the Superfeet. I have them for my hiking boots and cycling
shoes. You can get them from hiking/walkng shops. Superfeet are even
more expensive than Orthaheels (they are 30 pounds/ $48!!!) here, but
again are made in the US and are extremely reasonably priced there
(maybe $25 from stores that sell hiking boots, like <a href=
"http://rei.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ProductDisplay?prmenbr=8000&prrfnbr=6571">
REI</a>). </p>

<p> I've found that for me, an acceptable substitute for Superfeet are
<a href="http://www.spenco.com/polysorb.html">Spenco Polysorb
insoles</a>. They aren't exactly arch supports, more of heel cushions,
but they seem to provide enough to keep my feet happy while
cycling. They also have the advantage of being warmer than Superfeet,
since they have have a thick layer of insulating neoprene on top of
them. This makes them good for winter use. They are also quite a bit
cheaper than Superfeet, at $15 to $18 depending on model. </p>

<p> Although I haven't tried them, I feel that I can recommend
Birkenstock footbeds, in particular the blue ones, for cycling. I am
very happy with Birkenstock products in general. I own three pairs of
their sandals, and my husband has two pairs, as well as a pair of
their Footprints shoes that he really likes (he has the same sort of
arch problems that I do). In addition, I recently received an email
from Daniel Ford, who found that these insoles have solved his foot
problems while cycling. He writes "The thing I like most about
Birkenstock's arch supports is the metatarsal support", so if that's
soemthing you're looking for in arch supports, these will be
definitely worth trying. </p>

<p> I still have a problem with shoes that have a small bit of arch
support, but not enough to keep my feet happy. If I put Orthaheels or
Superfeet in them I end with far too much arch support. If anyone has
any suggestions that might help, please let me know.... [2005 update:
I never did find a solution to this problem, so now I don't own any
shoes with small amounts of arch support. They either have none, so I can
add my own inserts, or they have lots of arch support already (like
Birkenstock sandals).] </p>
