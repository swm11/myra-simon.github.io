<h1>Boxing Day Cyclocross Race</h1>

<p> Boxing Day was cold, gray, windy, and raining. The kind of day
that makes you want to sit at home in your joggers and slippers,
whiling away the day watching videos. And so what did we do? We put on
walking boots, Gore-Tex jackets and rain hats, loaded the Nikon, and
trundled down to Kenilworth Common to watch the bike race.
Specifically, the Coventry Road Club's Annual Handicap Cyclo-Cross, a
tradition now in its 44th year. This is the longest running running
cyclocross race run on the same course. </p>

<p> The action started at 11:15am with the under-12 race. They did 10
laps along a very short, mostly-flat loop at the finish area. Ten or
so kids rolled up to for the start, all dressed in casual clothes
except for one little guy in ONCE team kit. I thought, how
ridiculous. I changed my mind very rapidly once the race started. At
the wave of the flag, the little ONCE guy jumped out in front, and
there he stayed. By the end of the race he had lapped the rest of the
field, including kids much bigger than he was. I talked with him
afterwards. His name is Shay Oliver, and at the age of seven he's
already an accomplished off-road racer. He has a pretty long list of
successes, including winning the Midlands Under-9 Championships a few
weeks ago. This kid is serious stuff. Keep an eye out for him in the
years to come. </p>

<p> The main race course is something like a mile long (no one knew
exactly how long it was) and takes about 6 minutes to go around. Its
surface is smooth, but very muddy in places. It goes up and down some
quite steep hills, including one climb up a long set of stairs just
after the start/finish. There is a tradition of wearing fancy dress at
this race. Most of the time this was accomplished by taping some
Christmas tree garland to the cycle helmet or jersey, but occasionally
there are costumes. This year the best one was a Christmas tree. Last
year there was a Santa and a guy with fake breasts and shiny silvery
tights. </p>

<p> The "Handicap" in the title means that all the racers ride
together as one big field. The riders set off in groups, with the
slower groups going first. The early starters don't have any real
chance of wining the race, but they have a good shot at the first few
primes (prizes given out each lap). There are prizes for the top 10
places in the field, and the top 3 veterans. Fifty one people had
registered for the race, but it's likely that a few stayed home due to
the bad weather. All the riders were men. Last year there were a
couple of women, but to my disappointment none raced this year. </p>

<p> The first group got going at 11:45, and they set off at 1 minute
intervals until the top seeded pair of Carl Sturgeon (last year's
winner) and Steve Knight (Midlands Champion) started at 11:50. Knight
pulled ahead in the short level stretch at the start and thus was
ahead of his rival in the run up the stairs.
</p>

<p> We walked around the course, watching the action and the bikes. In
this race, only bikes with 700c wheels are allowed, but that is the
only restriction. There was a good variety of machines. We saw quite a
few purebred Alan cyclocross bikes. Most bikes had two chainrings, but
a few had triples. The brakes were V-brakes or cantilevers. There were
a few bikes with straight bars, but the majority had traditional drop
bars. The shifters on the drop bar bikes were either integrated with
the brake levers or on the bar ends. The tires were very thin (in
comparison to mountain bike tires) and had lots of little
knobblies. Green Michelin tires were pretty common. </p>

<p> The racers carried on through the wind and the rain, as spectators
clustered under brightly colored umbrellas around the tricky bits,
calling out encouragement to their favorites. "Go Darren!" "Yeah
Mike!" "Allez allez allez!" The riders rolled down steep slopes, brake
pads scraping away at the rims. They ground up the climbs, straining
against the high gears. They dismounted smoothly and shouldered their
bikes when it was too steep or muddy to ride, hopping back on again at
the top. By the time we'd established a place for ourselves on the
course, Carl Sturgeon was ahead of Steve Knight. Judging by the cheers
of the bystanders, local boy Darren Atkins of the Coventry Road Club
was nearby as well. </p>

<p> Some of the spectators (especially boys) had brought along their
mountain bikes and were using them to get around to watch different
sections of the course. This has provoked a great deal of controversy,
as bikes are forbidden from Kenilworth Common except for the riders in
this once a year race. The council think that that kids see the racers
and feel that this gives them permission to ride their bikes there
both during the race and at other times of the year.  The Coventry
Road Club had to go through quite a bit of negotiation to allow the
race to go ahead. In an attempt to ease tensions, there were posters
up asking race spectators to leave their bikes at home. This seems to
have had some effect, as I saw fewer bikes being ridden around this
year than last year. </p>

<p> At the end of an hour we made our way to the start/finish area. As
we neared it we heard the bell ring. In a cyclocross race, when the
leaders come though after one hour has passed, the last lap has
begun. Sturgeon kept his lead, and at the end of the lap, he coasted
through the finish line, a winner again. A few more people came
through the gates, but the crowds' silence showed that these had been
lapped. Cheers again: it was Darren Atkins! Steve Knight came in at
third. The other contestants rolled in. They pulled on warm dry
clothes, clearly relieved that the race was over. After drinking tea
and chatting about the race, the party gradually packed up to head to
the local cricket club for the ceremonies. And we headed back home,
full of admiration for the racers. </p>
