<p>  Hi. This is inspired by <a

  VanInwegen's Bike Articles</a> , especially the ending statement on
  the <a href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/bike/LEDupgrade.html">
  LED Upgrades</a> page. Myra, Simon... Thanks for such a great
  site. </p></blockquote>

      <h1> Dissection 101</h1>

<blockquote>
<p> Actually no, the board is not solidly soldered into place. Upgrade
away!  The battery tabs have angled latchy bits (teeth?) that grip the
plastic; They go in easily but remove with a bit more difficulty. To
remove the circuit board, just stick a (strong) flat tip screwdriver
under the battery contacts and apply some upward force. You can work
between the plastic cracks and try to flatten the "teeth" down a bit
to make removal easier, but in the two that I've modded they removed
without too much effort... or fear of breaking them. As long as you
know it's not glued down I'm sure you'll figure out how to remove it
without breaking it. Just remember to do both ends at the same time;
if you pop a trace off the board while flexing it, that's more repair
work for you. :-) </p></blockquote>

      <h1> The bored, err, board</h1>

<p> Don't you have more important things you should be doing? Since
 the point of this is to make the tail light more visible cheaply, we
 won't discuss the chip under the epoxy dot. I have no interest in
 reverse engineering a $1 blinkie and neither should you. The basic
 (partial) schematic is shown to the right.</p>

<p> Ok, ok, it didn't cost <i>you</i> $1... but to bother
reverse-engineering this? Volume coupled with exchange rate and I'm
guessing this thing doesn't cost half a dollar.</p><br clear=all>

      <h1> Modifications!</h1>
   <b>1) Add two more LEDs</b>
           
<blockquote> <p>I mean, come on. It's the TL-LD500. 5. As in 5 LEDs I
 bet. Yeathere's those two extra sets of holes in plain sight, what
 else would have motivated starting this project in the first place?
 Since all LEDs are parallel, adding more will lower the brightness of
 the others. Not because they're parallel mind you, but because the
 transistor's resistor coupled with base current is limiting what can
 get there in the first place. More on that in a minute.  The end
 result on brightness depends on what type, color, and efficiency LED
 you add.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<b> 2) Swap out the stock LEDs</b>   
<blockquote>

<i>Diffused and clear</i></td></tr>
</table>
           
      <p>The stock ones are diffused and fairly wide angle. They're pretty
 good LEDs in my lights, actually. Fairly bright and ~625nm red color. But
 technology marches on; there's always better and brighter available, every
 few months.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote> 

<b>3) Combine 1) and 2)</b>               
<blockquote>
      <p>You could take out the stock LEDs and move the two outer ones inward, 
 while inserting more directional ones on the ends and center.&nbsp; </p>
               
      <p>There is one note about the addition of LEDs: they are all driven
 parallel and there's only one resistor, meaning current will flow according
 to the individual LEDs... try to match the V<i>fd</i> or use all the same
 LEDs or you could end up with widely varying brightness across them. </p>
</blockquote>

<b>4) Angle of incident light (first real modification)</b>
               
<blockquote> <p>The point is to be seen easier and from farther
away. If you get LEDs that are too narrowly focused it will help
greatly for spotting you on a flat road hundreds of yards away, but
that's it. To compensate, experiment.  On the two outside LEDs stick
something under the inner-most lead when soldering to "kick it out" to
the outside, a bit. A 22 gauge wire or small resistor or something,
you don't want it shining directly sideways.&nbsp; </p>
               
      <p>Because of the curve of the plastic and the cut of the reflector
 cubes you can get a GREAT IMPROVEMENT over the stock light for off-axis
viewing.  I don't suggest angling any of the other LEDs to the sides in the
slightest. </p>

 <p> What I <i>do</i> suggest is angling the center LED up a few
degrees. Yep.  Think about it. If you mounted your light on your
seatpost just under your ass, you have it in about as optimal a spot
for a seated driver in a passenger car as you can get. But what about
something sitting higher like a pickup, or Navigator-ish beast, or my
favorite road buddy the Kenworth W900?</p>

 <p> I highly suggest you blind them with one LED, anyway. Someone cussing your
obnoxious blinkie is better than getting squished. </p>

<b>5) Epileptic Fit</b>    
          
<blockquote> <p>Ok, the 360k resistor has both leads going into the
epoxy dot. It controls the flash rate in blink mode. It's still going
to be the same pattern; flash-flash-flash, pause. But you can speed it
up or slow it down by changing this. If you take it really low it gets
to behave like a strobe light! If you go lower than that, it'll just
stay on solid for a short while and proceed to fry your LEDs. See LEDs
cheat when flashing, they use much more current then they can
continuously sustain in these abbreviated duty cycles. (so do all your
remote controls' infrared LEDs)&nbsp; </p>
               
      <p>The quickest mod is to parallel a 1M resistor with it. That
is the same as desoldering that one and putting in a 270k, which makes
it appear more "urgent" to my test subjects.&nbsp; (about 1/3rd faster
rate)&nbsp;</p>
               
<p>I wouldn't make it any lower than 100k, and even that value I have
problems with as a useful bike light. You really don't need to adjust
this; &nbsp;it's here nonetheless.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<b>6) So I rewired it...</b>              

<blockquote><p>You are now entering Tim Taylor territory. While what
I'm about to tell you works, and probably (probably) won't catch fire
or send you to the hospital or explode your taillight. I DID THIS, I
AM NOT TELLING YOU TO DO THIS.&nbsp; <br> If you do and it
hurts... it's your fault.&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Ok since the LEDs are parallel through that one 2.4 ohm resistor,
we have a limiting factor. But do the math for +3V and LEDs with an
average 2.0V<i>fd</i> and you'll see this is not the bottleneck. And
because of the magic black dot on the other side of that 330 ohm
resistor, we have an unknown I<i>b</i> situation. (since transistors
only do one thing...)&nbsp;
 </p>
               
<p>Again I don't want to reverse engineer this thing but suffice to
say that if you lower the base resistor then there's going to be
(probably!)  more I<i>b</i> and therefore more I<i>c. </i>Sure enough
if you parallel another resistor here you will get a slight increase
in brightness. SO I REWIRED IT. Bypass the resistor completely.&nbsp;
:-)&nbsp; </p>
               
<p>Seriously I (nor you) have any idea what the magic black dot is
providing, is capable of providing, nor is expecting to see as a
load. You could measure and extrapolate. But oh well. It'll make your
average current go to ~50mA (from 40mA) in continuous on mode if you
shunt the 330 ohm resistor.&nbsp; No other side effects like smoke or
pain, yet. It's been awhile.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<h1>It is so bright that...</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Well ok, it's brighter. How much so? It's alot, actually.&nbsp; More than 
 I expected. But only about 24 hours on constant, and I'm not sure on flashing 
but I assume the same percentage of reduction.</p>

      <p>I went with current generation 2000mcd 640nm 30&deg; 50mA
AllnGaP waterclear LEDs which certainly qualify as "high brightness"
staring at one at 3' will make you see color-negative spots for
awhile. These are also "deeper" red than the stock ones. While the
original light is rated at 6000mcd for 3 LEDs also, we all know that
gets skewed for sales not specifications. They are certainly not
2000mcd each - being wider angle and diffused they'd be brighter than
my replacements! </p>
       
      <p>How much brighter you LED swap will be will depend on what
LEDs you went with and if / how you modded the circuit. If you don't
have LEDs already, remember that one man's "high out" is another man's
"burnt out" - some companies will sell 200mcd as superbrights while
another sells 1500mcd versions with the same angle. Don't get suckered
by the whole angle issue - <i>of course </i> a narrower beam will have
more millicandelas at a fixed distance target - but that doesn't mean
it's brighter. Only compare apples to apples.</p>
       
      <p>At a measured 100m, it's apparently 6x as bright according to
test guinea pigs.. er, volunteer ocular technicians. BTW it makes a
great pocket flashlight now too. </p>
              
      <p>I wish the ol digicam took better pics; it cannot. Again,
technology marches on. There are much better cameras than a Olympus
D-320 today, but hey it's paid for and still works. The pictures don't
do the lights justice; but both are crippled equally.  The ratio is
about the same; that is, the modified one swamps the stock one in all
aspects. </p>

      <p>Total mod cost was under $3. Makes for a great bag
blinkie. And a spare taillight or even primary taillight if you want
to risk it. Certainly more visible than the stock TL-LD500. It's still
not as noticable as a Vistalite Total Eclipse, but then the Vistalite
has a special magnifying reflector and does NOT meet
C.P.S.C. qualifications as a reflector.</p>
       
      <p>It goes without saying (well not now) that you could modify a clear
front version of the LD500 to have some seriously bright orange/amber LEDs
(a very efficient wavelength)</p>

      <p> Again, thanks to Myra for the original tweak idea.</p>
