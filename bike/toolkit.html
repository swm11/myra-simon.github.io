<h1> A minimal toolkit </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> Here is a list of stuff you should take with you on every ride
that's long enough that you wouldn't like to walk back from it. It will
fix the most common problems you will have with your bike. </p>

<ul>
<li> A pump. The best ones for road use are the Xefal HP X pumps.  You
can get away with a mini-pump on mountain bikes, since they don't
need such high pressure. The Blackburn Mammoth is the best I've seen.

<li> Tire levers for getting your tires off the wheels. Plastic ones
are better than metal ones, as they won't damage your rim. For some
mountain bike tires you can get away without this, as you can get the
tires off the rims with just your fingers. Obviously, try this before
going out without tire levers.

<li> A spare tube. This allows you to get back underway rapidly if you
only get one puncture. 

<li> A patch kit. You often get punctures in both tires. 
 You can get either a traditional patch kit with rubber patches and
glue, or a glueless patch kit like Park Super Patch. I find that the
glueless patches don't work very well for me on road tubes, but they
are fine for MTB tubes. However, they are more expensive than the
traditional patches.

<li> If your wheels are fastened on with plain nuts (not with a quick
release), you need a wrench (spanner) to remove and reinstall
them. Either carry one of the right size, or a 6" or 8" adjustable
spanner.

<li> Allen keys or wrenches (spanners) for the bolts on your
bike. Most bolts on modern bikes have heads that take Allen (or hex)
wrenches. If you take 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm keys, you'll cover most
bolts on your bike. It's a good idea to see if this set covers what
you'll need to adjust. You can get these in a folding tool that keeps
them all together, or you can get them at part of a multi-tool. If you
have an older bike, it will have lots of traditional bolts and nuts,
which require open end or box end spanners (wrenches) to adjust. You
should have a small adjustable wrench with you to tighten them up, or
several sizes specific to the bolts on your bike.
</ul>

<p> Well, that's it. There are more things you can carry if you want,
like screwdrivers, pliers, chain tools, and spoke wrenches. These
sometimes come in useful, but they won't be needed as often as the items
in the list above.  </p>
