<h2>The Penn State Cycling Classic (Race # 4)</h2>

<p> There were two races that our team went to this past weekend:
Saturday, April 1st, was Bucknell (Lewisburg PA) and Sunday was Penn
State (University Park Campus in State College PA). I have a friend,
Sundar at Penn State, so I decided to skip the Bucknell race and spend
the weekend in State College with him. Part of the team (Randy, Brian,
Tiffany, Mike) would be doing both races, part of it (Amanda, John,
and our coach Pete) would only be going to the Bucknell race, and some
(Lauren, Dave, and me) would only be going to the Penn State
race. Those who were doing the Bucknell race only would head back to
Philly after that race; those doing both races would stay in a hotel
in State College Saturday night, and the rest would come up Saturday
afternoon and also stay in the hotel, so they wouldn't have to get up
early Sunday to drive out. </p>

<p> When I read the description of the race, I wondered: should I race in
the A race or the B race? There are only two women's categories, A and
B. In collegiate cycling, you can pick your own category. I registered
as a B, figuring that if I did well then I could switch to being an
A. Last week's race in Bloomsburg (which was combined A and B) made me
wonder if I was an A racer already -- altho' I got dropped from the
front group and did the race (a crit -- 15 laps around a short loop,
for 12.5 or so miles in total) pretty much on my own, I managed to go
virtually the same speed as the front group and finished 45 seconds
behind them, and 45 seconds over a 40 minute race is not much. </p>

<p> However, I was a bit worried about the distance. After the Bloomsburg
race I was completely exhausted, and that race was only 12.5 miles
long. The Penn State race was a road race -- it was a long loop of 13
miles, and the women's B race did 2 laps and the A race did three. Of
course, somehow I knew that because it was a longer race, people
wouldn't be going as fast, and I have alot of endurance anyway. I
wrote to Randy, Brian, and Pete, asking for advice. Randy said that
road races are usually much gentler than crits, and I should go for
the A race. Pete said that, in his opinion, it would be better for me
to do very well in the B race, rather than just mediocre in the A
race, since it would be a big boost to my confidence. But, he said, in
the end it was my decision. I usually take Pete's advice, so I figured
I'd probably do the B race. But I took along stuff I would need for
the A race anyway -- an extra water bottle, Gatorade powder, food I
could eat on the bike (granola bars, fig bars). </p>

<p> I went up to State College on Friday, and Saturday evening I met the
rest of the team and had dinner with them. I asked if someone had
gotten our racing licenses from Pete, who had been keeping track of
them.  Randy said he had them. Of course, I should have asked for mine
then, but I didn't think of it... </p>

<p> Sunday I got up late (my race wasn't supposed to start until 2pm) and
had a leisurely breakfast. Then got into my bike things and we drove
to the race start. Sundar wanted to take pics of me in the race, which
I thought was a cool idea. I got there just as Randy and Brian's race
was starting. The official announced: one minute to start time.
"Where's my license?" I shouted out to Randy.  "In my left coat
pocket, the coat is in the car, Tiff has the keys".  And then they
started... </p>

<p> I wondered about the time. Randy's race was supposed to start at
11:15, and it had just started at 12:30. They seemed to be quite a bit
behind time. I found other members of the team, and then we had to
look around for Randy's car. Tiff eventually found it, and I was able
to get my license and register for the race... Sundar picked up a map
of the route so he could drive around and take pics. </p>

<p> Time dragged on, and the Men's A and B races went by every now and
then. The weather was really freaky -- it would be cloudy, and then it
would snow a little, despite the weather being in the 40s, and then
the sun would break out and it would feel warm. It kept alternating
like this the whole day. Finally, at about 3:15, the A and B races
were over. Because it was so late, an official asked us women if we
would mind if they cut the distance of the races, down to 2 laps for
the As, 1 lap for the Bs. I have to say, most of us were happy about
the change. We were fed up with waiting, annoyed with the weather,
etc. We agreed. I dropped my second water bottle, just taking a small
one along. </p>

<p> The A women started first. The official gave the usual instructions
(Two laps and you're done. Watch out for cars -- this isn't a closed
course.) She said "When I blow the whistle the race starts", and then
she blew it! This was the least preparation I've ever had; usually
they count down to let you get prepared to start. I started my timer
(trying once again to time the race) and got going. No troubles with
getting attached to pedals this time. </p>

<p> They went a decent speed, not too fast. I could keep up. I am keeping
up, I told myself. I can do it! I went around corners next to people.
They didn't go too fast, so it wasn't a problem. I wonder if it would
have been so simple going thru' turns next to people in Bloomsburg, if
I hadn't been too scared to try. At each major intersection there were
marshals who stopped the traffic when the racers went by. The Penn
State girls in the pack shouted out the turns. </p>

<p> Then we got to the big hill. Basically, this hill takes you from the
valley up to a ridge. I'd ridden along the ridge Saturday, so I knew
how high it was above the valley. It was high enough that I hadn't
wanted to go down off it, knowing that I'd just have to come back up
again. Going up this hill, I gradually dropped off. I just couldn't go
fast enough to keep up with them. In fact the group that I'd been
riding with broke up into two parts -- a small front group, a larger
group with Tiffany in it, and I'd fallen off the back. I told myself
that I'd catch back up when I got to the top. And meanwhile, I watched
the gap between them and me gradually widen. </p>

<p> I got to the top, turned left, and then found the wind in my face and
I knew it was hopeless -- no way could I catch up alone. Damn. I was
not happy. Racing is riding with people, jockying for position,
drafting, making breaks, knowing where your teammates are, working
together. Or, if you're riding with a bunch of people who are better
than you are, doing your damnedest to hold with the pack. And I
couldn't do any of this. Just another solo training ride. The most I
could look forward to is maybe catching someone who'd dropped off the
back of one of the groups in front of me, but even if someone did, it
would be unlikely that I'd catch her, since she'd already be so far
ahead of me. I also thought it unlikely that any of the people who had
dropped off before me would catch me -- I'd held with the front group
for longer, so I was probably stronger and I have the endurance to
last.  I saw Sundar along the side of the road, taking pics. Great, I
thought, he'll get a fine picture of me, since I'm on my own... </p>

<p> I looked behind me and saw someone in yellow. I'd noticed a guy on a
mountain bike as I turned the corner after the hill, so I thought it
was him and ignored it. Not long after however, an Army woman came up
next to me. She asked me if I'd like to work together with her, or if
I'd like to ride alone. Well, sure, I thought, it would be nice to
ride with someone. So we worked together, taking turns pulling.
Generally, when one of us felt that the person in front wasn't going
fast enough, the other would pass. I noticed that the wind wasn't
coming straight at us, but instead with a strong sideways component,
coming from the right. I found that I stayed out of the wind better by
being to her left, my front wheel about parallel to her rear wheel. My
first experience with an echelon! </p>

<p> We went along the ridge, and then down, then along a really crappy
service road that looked like it hadn't been paved in a couple of
decades, full of potholes and patches. Then we started heading towards
the gym buildings that mark the start/finish line.  When we came to a
turn we'd shout to the marshal "Which way?", and he or she would point
out the direction. </p>

<p> We finished the first lap with me pulling. My team yelled "Go Myra"
and someone, probably from her team, said "Work together!". She took
over shortly after that and for some reason I remembered the course
better than she did, she'd ask me the way to go and I'd shout
directions. Then my turn to lead again, and we went around some turns.
I headed towards the middle of the road, cut as close to the curb as I
could during the turn, and then after getting around the corner
straightened out again. She commented that I take corners much better
than she does. I was kind of proud. Corners are something that I was
miserable with when I started out race training. But now I can take
them pretty fast. I've learned one thing -- never ever brake on a
corner. You can brake before if you need to, but if you brake while
you're turning, you'll lose it. So if you feel you're going too fast
thru' a corner, just hang in there, lean as hard as you can, point
your knee, concentrate, and pray you make it. It's worked well for me
so far. </p>

<p> I noticed that I was pulling more often now, and I'd have to ease off
every now and then to let the Army woman catch up with me. I began to
wonder if I should head off on my own. After all, if I stayed with her
too long, there was some chance she could put on a burst of speed at
the end and take me in a sprint. Then I thought about the headwind
along the ridge and realized it would be nice if I could sit behind
her for a bit during that section. I got to the base of a hill, the
start of the climbs that take you to the top of the ridge. This was at
a left turn, and Sundar was there with the camera, shooting away. I
shifted from my big chainring to my middle. And the chain caught
between the two chainrings and jammed. Damn. The Army woman said "I'll
wait for you, if you don't take too long" and went on. I swore up a
storm, and I'm sure Sundar got some nice pics of me yanking my chain
out from between the chainrings... I finally got the thing out and
back on the middle chainring and then got going again. I was in the
wrong gear, big time, but the bike cooperated by shifting down
correctly, despite me putting tremendous amounts of pressure on the
pedals. I also somehow managed to get my feet attached to the pedals
while going up the hill. </p>

<p> My bike has done this before, but if I shift carefully enough, it
doesn't happen. I'd been noting hills as they came up, and shifting to
the middle chainring before the slope really started going. This time
I was shifting hurriedly, since the hill caught me unaware. There were
two marshals at the corner, one at the intersection, and one to the
right, so I thought that we'd be turning right. But right went over a
bridge, and I didn't remember going over a bridge... I asked "Which
way" and they pointed left, up the hill. So I had already started
going up the hill when I shifted, and I didn't take enough care to do
it right, resulting in my chain jam. </p>

<p> After getting moving I pedaled hard and after not too long caught up
with the Army woman. I said "This is what happens when you try to use
a 7 year old touring bike for racing..." </p>

<p> Then came the big hill again. I stayed in my saddle going up it, not
feeling energetic enought to climb it standing up. But here's the
funny thing -- I got into to good rhythm going up the hill and felt
the strength in my legs. When the slope eased off I picked up the
speed and went around the corner pretty fast. The Army woman had
dropped off. I waited for her, and we alternated pulls into the
headwind. Then, when I was in front we went up a smallish hill, and I
was working hard to keep a decent speed. After getting to the top I
looked back and saw that she had dropped off. I eased off a bit, but
then realized that this was the time to make my break -- I was just
about thru' the section with the headwinds, and she wasn't with me and
so couldn't draft me, so all I had to do was stay away from her and
I'd make sure I finished before her. I pedaled hard and steady. Every
now and then I'd look back and she was a bit further behind. I was
doing it. Eventually when I looked back I couldn't see her, but I kept
the speed up. </p>

<p> There were some short uphills on the service road before the end
stretch. I took them standing. I thought "This really hurts, but it'll
be over soon". Coming into the final stretch I thought, "I could just
coast in and no one would pass me". But, no, got to keep up
appearances. I kept going strong. I contemplating sprinting at the
finish line, but why? There was no one around... At the finish line I
turned off the timer. Since I'd ditched the Army girl I'd had no
competition and therefore had plenty of time to think and remind
myself to turn it off. The first time I've successfully timed a race!
It took 1hr 24mins 10sec.  My trip meter read 24.6 miles, so my
average speed was 17.5 mph. </p>

<p> I came back to my teammates at the finish line and Dave handed me my
jacket. I asked Tiff how many minutes ago she'd come in, and, being
kind, she said "It doesn't matter..." I found out that Lauren had won
the B race, and Tiffany had come in the second group in the A race. I
asked at the control tent, and found that I'd come in 10th in a race
that started out with 16 people. When I asked, only 14 in total had
come in. </p>

<p> We headed back to the cars and split up in our respective cars and
headed home. When I got back I called Pete to tell him how I did. He
told me he'd been agonizing about which race to tell me to go in. I'm
really between A and B, sort of an A-. I'm not able to keep up with
the front pack in A races, they lose me on hills, but I'd be out of
place in the B races. I wish there were more women bikers. Then I'd be
able to find a group of people to ride with. My problem, Pete says, is
that I'm good on average, but I can't put out the bursts of power to
keep up with the pack when they're going hard, like up hills. </p>

<p> What to do? I could keep racing the A races, and keep attempting to
stay with the front group. Or I could race in B races and try to break
away, or work with Lauren (and Amanda, if she's racing) to absolutely
destroy the other B racers. But I realize now, if I break off on my
own in a B race, it'd be just as un-fun as riding on my own in an A
race. I don't think it would be such a big thrill knowing that I'm
ahead of the rest of the pack, rather than being behind it. Actually,
Pete says that there's still a chance that I could do well at the A
level, under certain circumstances, like if the race is on a flat
course... I don't know for now. </p>

<p> Right now I need some rest. My left knee has been bothering me for
awhile, and I want to give it a chance to heal some... Ah, I'm not as
young as I used to be. Damn, and I'm not even 30 yet... </p>

<hr>

<p> The Penn Cycling Team continues to place in the money on the Collegiate 
racing circuit.  This past weekend, the team traveled to Bucknell 
University on Saturday and Penn State, State College on Sunday. </p>

<p> Both races were well-attended by many schools including Princeton, 
Bucknell, Bloomsburg, Penn State, New Hampshire, Ithaca College, Cornell, 
Massachusetts, Boston College, Rutgers, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, Army, Navy, and many more.   </p>

<p> At Bucknell, the team competed in a tough criterium of a 0.7-mile loop
with a 0.25-mile climb in the heart of campus.  The racers were visible to
the spectators at almost all points along the course making for a very
exciting event.  </p>

<p> The newly reborn Penn team made a very strong showing despite its small 
size. </p>

<p> Amanda Fine in her first NCCA (National Collegiate Cycling Association) 
race, competed in the Women's B event, a 20-lap, 14-miler.  She 
maintained her position with the lead group throughout the race and 
finished fourth in the field sprint, an impressive showing for her first 
race. </p>

<p> In the Women's A catagory, a 30-lap, 21-mile race, Tiffany Pezzulo
placed 2nd, outdistancing Susan George of Penn State, a multitime
junior national champion, among other strong contenders. Tiffany
continues her outstanding performances competing against the East's
top collegiate women. </p>

<p> The Men's C catagory race featured Penn's Mike Riley and John McDonald.  
The race was approached conservatively by all the riders in the pack 
until, with 3 laps to go, Mike rolled strongly off the front in a solo 
break-away.  John, an experienced USCF (United States Cycling Federation) 
racer quickly moved to the front to ensure that Mike's gap steadily 
widened.  At the top of the small hill stood Penn's coach, Dr. Peter 
Durdaller, who was heard to yell to Mike with two and a half to go, 
"DECIDE!"  Mike stayed off the front for another lap.  This time Dr. Pete 
encouraged him yelling, "PUSH IT, PUSH IT;  Squeeze out the hill;  COME 
ON, GO,GO!!!"  Meanwhile John was doing everything he could to thwart any 
chase attempt by the main pack.  With half a lap to go, Mike had 
maintained a now insurmountable lead of 11 seconds.  Mike crossed the 
finish line alone in 1st place with his hands in the air and a smile on 
his face.  John finished in the field with the satisfaction that Penn had 
taken the gold. </p>

<p> The Men's B race was a 30-lap, 21-mile event which was race much less 
conservative than the C race.  It contained numerous attacks and 
attempted break-aways.  Brian Hirsch and Randy Knarr represented Penn.  
They responded well to the attacks, putting them in some of the breaks, 
and were the driving force in a couple of chases to bring back breaks.  
In the end though the result was a field sprint in which Randy place 8th 
and Brian, 20th. </p>

<p> The Penn State Cycling Classic is a road race on a 12.5-mile loop north 
and west of the campus.  The course include several short climbs with a 
long steep one, half way around the loop.  </p> 

<p> The women's B race, a one-lap event, featured Penn's Lauren Slawe.  Lauren
stayed with the front group for nearly the entire race until the last
short steep hill at the 11-mile mark where she suddenly jumped.  She
gapped the others and strongly maintained the distance all the way to the
finish line.  Lauren was elated that her hard work and training had paid
off in only her second race! </p> 

<p> After a hard fought battle in the two-lap women's A race, Tiffany cruised
across the line in fifth place, and Myra in 10th.  The break of three
which formed the gap on the long climb were relentless to stay away from
the others chasing.  Tiffany reduced the gap to 20 seconds with a New
Hampshire girl shadowing her every move.  New Hampshire had another woman
in the break so she did not help chase at all.  Myra dropped her chain on 
one of the climbs which forced her back from the main packs.  Towards the 
end of the 1st lap she teamed up with one of the Army women to help fight 
the wind through the downhill and flat sections.  Not taking any chances 
in the sprint, Myra dropped her on the final hill to cross the finish 
line alone. </p>

<p> The men's D race of two laps featured Penn's Dave Copas.  He gritted his 
teeth in the grueling 25-mile race, surviving the mile climbs in good 
form.  The field became very strung out especially during the last lap.  
In only his second NCCA appearence, Dave's hard fought efforts landed him 
a very respectable 12th place of the 35 who started the race. </p>

<p> Mike was again in the Men's C race in which he attacked several times.  
He maintained gaps for minutes at a time.  In the last of three laps, he 
worked his way into a three-man break away, and finished 2nd in the 
sprint at the line.   </p>

<p> Randy and Brian competed in the 4-lap, 50-mile, men's B race.  Penn State
dominated the race by covering all breaks, attacking often, and marking
certain riders.  In the third lap Cornell and Penn State hooked up for a
two-man break.  Many attacks from the main pack were tried in order to
real in the two riders, but no organized chase ever materialized.  Randy
tried to spark the chase more than once by pulling downhill into the wind. 
Twice he was dropped on inclines because of the downhill efforts, but he
managed to reconnect with the main pack.  Brian also tried to get
numerous chases started by pulling through and off and yelling
instructions so the other teams would participate.  He also chased down
some of the early breaks to keep Penn State somewhat under control.  All
efforts to organize a chase were futile.  Randy sat in the pack for the
last lap and waited for the field sprint.  By then four were off the front
and still no chase!  Randy led out the field sprint and took 3rd therein
and 7th overall.  Brian finished in the field at 23rd.  </p>

<p> The overall team results were not available at the time of this
writing. </p>

<p> The Penn Cycling Team has scored at least one win in each of its first 
three collegiate meets.  Other teams are impressed with our strong 
showings with such a small team.  We all look forward to racing at the 
Penn Invitational in Trenton this Sunday and the Eastern District 
Championship at West Point on April 28 and 29. </p>
