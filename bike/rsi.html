<h1> Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) </h1>

<blockquote>

<p> This may not seem very related to cycling, but for me it was.
When I got hit with RSI in 1996 it kept me off my bike for a few
months. Ever so gradually over the years I recovered, having lots of
setbacks, and only now am I beginning to get back to the way I was
before to 1996.  </p>

<p> My RSI was caused mainly by years of bad typing. I would slouch at
the desk with my elbows on the edge of the table, forearms lying along
the surface, with only my hands lifted up to use the keyboard. In
addition, I would hit the keys very hard. At that time I had one bike
that I used almost all the time. It was a touring bike, with a 53cm
long top tube. I had a short stem (7cm), but the bars were quite few
inches below the saddle. This felt fine to me, so I wondered why many
women complained about their bikes, or bought hybrids with straight
bars instead of touring bikes with drop bars. </p>

<p> I was especially brutal to my hands when I typed up my thesis in
autumn 1995 and spring 1996. However, somehow they survived, but
stopped working a few weeks after I arrived in Cambridge to start a
post-doc. I was typing a few things in an awkward position when
showing something to a co-worker, when my left hand suddenly stopped
working. The left forearm seemed to have given up. I couldn't even
turn door handles. And I found that I couldn't ride a bike for any
length either before my left arm refused to support my weight. This
was not good. </p>

<p> I rested for a few weeks, and then tried typing again, but I
changed my typing style to the "official" way. I raised my chair quite
a bit, so that when I let my arms hang down from my shoulders and bend
my elbows at about 90 degrees, my hands end up positioned over my
keyboard which is near the edge of the table. I also learned to type
very lightly. Instead of bashing the keys as I used to, I now gently
press them, putting only enough pressure on them to make the character
appear on the screen. Finally, I found that pressing more than one key
at a time per hand made the tendons in my forearms twinge. So I
changed my typing style to prevent this. This meant that I would use
the right shift or control or alt key in combination with a letter or
number key that I would type with my left hand. </p>

<p> The editor I use, emacs, sometimes seems to demand that three keys
are pushed at the same time, for example to type Meta-$ (meta is
emacs-speak for the alt key), you have to type alt-shift-4. However,
the escape key works as a substitute for the alt key: if you hit the
esc key, the next key you hit will behave as if you had pressed the
alt key at the same time (sort of like a one-keystroke caps lock).  So
I would type esc, shift-4 to have the effect of Meta-$. This generates
more keystrokes, but saves my hands from the awkward stretches. </p>

<p> Bikewise, I initially kept riding the same bike in the same
style. After my forearm got better, I noticed that I had problems with
my elbows, mostly my left elbow. I now suffered from tendonitis in the
elbow, otherwise known as tennis elbow (or reverse tennis elbow, I
never could remember which). I would slowly increase my mileage, and
then the problems would reoccur. Gradually, I realized that I was
putting far too much weight on my hands and arms. In the autumn of
1998 I stopped riding my old touring bike and started riding a
mountain bike with a very upright riding position. The change was
immediate: the distance I could ride was limited by my legs and
bottom, not my arms and elbows! In the couple of years since then,
I've changed all my bikes around so that I have a much more upright
riding position (see <a href="bodge.html">Bodge your bike to fit
</a>). </p>

<p> Another thing that has helped is frequent rubs of my arms and
shoulders by my boyfriend, which helps loosen them up so they don't
bother me too much. Self massage is good too, of the areas I can
reach, in particular the tendons near my elbow which still bother
me. Stretching also helps.  </p>

<p> The results are that I'm now back into doing the distance riding
that I like. In 1999 I did my first century since '96 (which I did
just before my arms/hands started acting up), and in 2000 I've done 6
rides of 95 miles or more, including a 170 mile ride from <a
href="camb-york.html">Cambridge to York</a>. However I still have to
be very careful. Still I occasionally end up typing too much or too
hard and I have to ease off a bit. </p>
