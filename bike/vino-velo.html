<h1>Myra Does Speed (Rides)</h1>

<p> I met Taylor on a Bike Club of Philly C ride in early July. The
rankings are sort of like this: A = racers, B = pretty good riders, C
= casual riders or out-of-shape B riders, D = your grandmother or lazy
C riders. I'm the textbook definition of a B rider. Or at least I was;
I think I may have moved up to B+ recently. I occasionally go on C
rides, but usually for the company, not for the exercise.
Unfortunately, the bike club has very few B rides, so I often end up
going out on my own or with non-bike-club friends in order to get a
ride that's just right for me. </p>

<p> On this particular ride, Taylor had tagged along because he was the
only one that had shown up for a show-and-go ride (ie, leaderless
ride) that started close to the same time and place as our ride. We
got to talking, and he got to complaining that the ride was too
slow. I agreed with him, but told him that I was planning on going on
the afternoon ride as well in order to get something of a workout.
Anyway, he told me about a ride that he goes on that might suit me.
It's called the Vino Velo ride, it goes on Tuesday and Thursday
evenings (with different courses; the Thursday ride is hillier) on
5:45 and 6pm both days. The 5:45 version is quite a bit slower than
the 6pm version, tho' they follow the same routes. So I thought that
the 5:45 Tuesday ride might be something that I could try. I wasn't
sure I could keep up, but at least I wanted to see if I could. And
Taylor said that he'd ride with me to make sure I stayed on the
course, even if I couldn't keep up. </p>

<p> I showed up at the appropriate spot Tuesday evening, found a group of
bikers and asked them if this was the ride I was looking for. They
promptly gave me the impression that yep, this was the right ride, but
I was still in the wrong place. Let's put it this way -- all these
people have light racing bikes, skinny tires, clipless pedals, and
brightly colored and patterned jerseys. So here I am with my 6 year
old touring bike, complete with fenders, rear rack, cantilever brakes,
granny gear, toe clips and touring shoes, and plain dull colored
Coolmax jersey bought on sale from Performance. They told me "You
can't keep up on that bike". They warned me "But this is a 30-mile
ride" "But there are hills". Ha, twice a week I do 35mile hilly
rides. I told them "The hills and the distance won't be a problem; the
speed might". They wondering what would happen when I lost them, and
how I would get back, since I didn't know the route. Just then Taylor
showed up and told them that he'd take care of me, and they said "Oh,
OK". </p>

<p> On the way out a woman (Erica) showed up, also not sure if she could
keep up the pace. Taylor and I said she could ride with us. Well, we
took off, and the pace was mild to start off. But, after a couple of
miles, it picked up. I almost kept up with the pack up the first hill,
and I caught back up to them after it levelled off. Then I looked
around. Erica and Taylor were not in sight. Oooops. I slowed down, and
several people (who hadn't quite been able to keep up on the first
hill) passed me. Still no sight of them. I stopped, and eventually
they showed up. Taylor was staying with her because he'd said that she
could ride with us. And so the three of us stuck together until the
end, with Taylor and I waiting on hills for Erica to catch up. I was
surprised that she wasn't faster. After all, she had a racing bike and
clipless pedals, and looked very fit (more than I do), but I guess
she's just not as used to biking as I am, in fact she said that she
was mainly into running and had just picked up biking... </p>

<p> The course is actually quite nice. It weaves in and out of Fairmount
Park, then goes thru' some shady suburbs, then along some more open
roads, and then thru' the nicest part -- wide open green fields, and
then back to Philly via the bike path and Kelly Drive (both quite
flat). It's 29 miles in total. And the hills are really quite mild. My
definition of a hill is something that I really have to work to get
up, something that requires me to shift to the granny gear if I don't
want to wear myself out too quickly or destroy my knees. And this ride
had none of that -- I could go up all the rises quite comfortably in
my middle chainring. Anyway, since I'd been able to keep up with the
pack at the begining of the course, and since I liked the route, and
since Taylor offered to ride with me again, I decided I'd do it the
next time.  According to Taylor, their average speed over the course
is 17-something mph. </p>

<p> Next week I came back. This time no one questioned my touring bike. I
started out with the others, but by the second hill I was dropped. I
was giving it my all, biking so hard it hurt, but it wasn't good
enough. Oh, well. But Taylor stayed back with me, and we went on. By
the time we reached the end, we'd gotten caught back up to some people
who'd fallen off the back of the pack, and we rode in a pace line on
Kelly Drive. This was the first time I'd ridden in a real pace line,
and I didn't quite realize what was happening. By the time I realized
that I was in the lead it was too late for me to do anything about
it... And then it was over. </p>

<p> The third week on the ride I felt better after that first hill. It
didn't completely whipe me out, as it usually did. So I had some in
reserve and stayed on longer than before. Even after I dropped off the
back I never completely lost sight of the front of the pack. In fact,
they had to stop for one of the guys to pump up his tire, so we
(Taylor was still staying with me when I dropped back) got caught back
up. They got ahead again later, but we still never completely lost
sight of them. </p>

<p> Last week, by the time the first hill was over I knew I was doing
better. I knew that I'd be able to keep up much longer than before,
maybe even to the end. And I stayed with the pack. Even with the head
of the pack -- the group split up and lots of people peeled off from
the leaders, but I fought hard and kept with the leaders.  Taylor, of
course, went with me. The leaders would get ahead every now and then,
but not by much, and I'd get caught back up. Success! I felt
good. Part of me kind of dreaded those Tues evening rides, since there
was so much mental and physical pain involved -- physical pain trying
to keep up, and mental pain at getting left behind despite my best
efforts. But no more... I could do it. I realize that part of my
success was all the new parts on my bike that week -- chainrings,
freewheel, chain, rear wheel, areo brake levers, and the efficiency of
the new drivetrain (the old one was quite worn) must have helped
alot. But also, I think part of it was my additional strength and
speed. I also noticed that I was taking hills better than Taylor --
I'd just sit down and spin up in a low gear, and he'd be pushing along
in too high a gear, and I'd pass him. </p>

<p> This week, more success -- I kept up again. This time, Taylor and I
were the leaders for part of the ride. I'm actually beginning to like
these rides. It's no longer do-or-die, embarassment at being left
behind, continually striving at trying to keep up. It's still a good
workout, but I no longer have to put everything I have, mentally and
physically, into just trying to keep up. Now I <b>know</b> I can keep up,
and that feels a whole lot better. And I'm still the only one with a
touring bike, cantilever brakes, granny gear, fenders, a rear rack,
and touring shoes, but I can ride as well as anyone on that ride. </p>

<p> But there's still the 6pm crowd, who usually pass us 5:45 people about
4 miles from the end, going in a pace line at 26-27 mph. But I don't
think I'll try to keep up with them this year... </p>
