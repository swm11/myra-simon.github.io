<p> This was our last day in Scotland. Our goal for today was to get to
Inverness by about 6:30pm, giving us time to get some dinner before
catching our train at 8:40. We headed out of Balintore and saw a glass-
encased rock slab in the middle of a field. We followed a path through the
feld to check it out. It was a slab carved by people called the Picts about
1200 years ago. It had a some very intricate patterns on it: knots and
spirals and intertwined serpents, as well as reliefs of various animls and
people. One side had these complicated ptterns formed into a large
Christian cross. </p>

<p> We rode onward to the little village of Nigg, where we found a sgn
indicating another Pictish stone so we went into the church to examine this
one. It was similar to the first in having a cross on one side and various
carvings of animals nd people on the other. On top of the cross on this one
was illustrated an early Chistian parable. </p>

<p> Riding onward, we came to the Nigg ferry. Here we founnd a Sustrans Route 1
in pointing over the water, which we found amusing. Sustrans have
identified and sinposted various routes across the UK. They are
chracterized by choosing rods and paths that have as little interaction
with cars as possible, so they usually take the smallest roads possibe to
get where hey are going, and if there are no roads, they will sometimes use
paths. The result is some very nice scenery, but often a rough road surface
llots of steep hills, and a roundabout route. I feel that Sustrans routes
are best used as a general guide, to be departed from when you're tired of
hills and are willing to put up with a few cars in order to get where you're
going much quicker. </p>

<p> The Nigg Ferry runs from a point near Nigg village across the opening of
the Cromarty Firth to Cromarty. There has been a ferry there for centuries.
It used to be an important link in a trading route, then was used by
workers, but recently it is used mostly for tourists. It's a very short
ferry ride, only about 10 mins, and the ferry only has room for 2 cars,
making it the smallest car ferry in Britain. </p>

<p> In Cromarty we saw a collection of fully loaded cyclists and asked them
where they were from and where they were going. They were Australian and
riding from Land's End (the very southwest corner of Britain) to John
o'Groats in Scotland, the northeast corner of Britain. This is a journey of
roughly 1000 miles, depending on choice of route, and a major goal for many
British cyclists (and, it seems, a few foreigners). </p>

<p> Cromarty is the northern tip of the Black Isle, which isnt really an island
but a peninsula. It got its name from the rich dark soil. We saw a sign for
the Cromarty bakery and bought food for lunch: we weren't hungry then, but
there didn't look to be many places where we could get lunch before we got
to Inverness. </p>

<p> From Cromarty we followed a B-road tht hugged the north coast of the Black
Isle. it was dead flat, but there was a persistent headwind. After a few
miles we headed inward: we needed to get to the south coast to go across
the bridge to Inverness. This invoved a long climb and a fast descent. </p>

<p> We pulled into the little village of Munlochy hoping to be able to stop for
tea. We found a hotel/restaurant that had an OPEN sign, but all the doors
were locked. We've found thatin Scotland an OPEN sign doesn't necessrilly
mean open: in Dufftown last week Simon had wanted to buy whiskey from a
whiskey shop an bananas from a fruit shop, but despite open signs in both
places, they were decidedly shut. They did, however, reopen in 15 mins,
which didn't appear to be the case with this hotel. So we went on and
further down. </p>

<p> We saw a sign pointing down a side road for the Black Isle Brewery, so we
took it, reasoning that since we'd been to a winery and ddistillery it only
mde sense to go to a brewery. A couple of miles along the road we found it.
We got a quick tour of the brewery but were disapponted that we couldn't
sample the beers there we could only buy 50cl bottles. They told us that
the brewery owned  pub only a mle and a half away, and that we coul try the
beers there if we wanted to. It wasn't exactly on our way but we had plenty
of time to kill, so we went there. The barman gave us samples of all th
beers he had on tap and we bought half pints of our two favorites (Red Kite
Ale and the stout). We also ordered some soup to share, which was very
good. Then we shared a bottle of the wheat beer, which wasn't on tap. After
this I felt I'd had enough beer and ordered some tea while Simon went for a
hallf of the lager which had a great deal of flavor. </p>

<p> Finally it was time to go. On the way to the pub we hd passed a Sustrans
Route 1 sign, which pointed in the general direction of Inverness. We'd
noted Route 1 signs on the other side of Inverness, so we figured that the
route went through Inverness and so decided to follow it. The obvious route
was along the A9, a very fast dual carriageway, so if Sustrans had foundd
better way to get into Inverness we figured we'd take it. So we followe the
signs and found ourselves on some small back roads, only riding on a
pavement next to the A9 for a short stretch (including the bridge). After
getting off the bridge we went along  lightly-used industrial road into
Invernes. There we killed time by doing a bit of shopping (Simon wanted to
get little bottle of whiky for his co-workers) and eating, and then we
headed to the station to catch the train. </p>

<p> There were three bikes going onto the train: ours and that of an older
fellow. We got ours into place, hanging on the bike racks, and Simon went
to help the man put his up. He said to him "It will be difficult to put
your bike on the train because of all the fish". The man looked at him and
said "I'm sorry, you're not making ny sense!" And so Simon explained that
on the way south half of the bike spaces are occupied by styrofoam cartons
with seafood destined for London restaurants, which can make it more
diifcult to maneuver the bikes into the remaining spaces. Since it's not
very easy to hook the bikes on the racks in the first place, this can make
getting a bike into place quite difficult. So the man accepted Simon's help
and we all got on the train, and on our way to London. </p>

<p> Miles for today: 39. </p>
