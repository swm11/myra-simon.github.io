<h1> Scotland bike tour</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> In July 2002, Simon and I did a bike tour in Scotland. There were
alot of firsts about this tour: it was Simon's first tour, and it was
the first tour I had ever done with other people. We had some
disagreements about how to proceed with this tour. On my tours I tend
to like to take things a day at a time, and find accomodation at the
end of the day when I decide I've had enough. Simon is more
conservative and wanted everything booked in advance so we know we'd
have a bed to go to, but I didn't want to go to the effort of doing
that much planning. We compromised: we let someone else do the
planning. Our friends Sue and Neil, whom we know through the local
branch of the CTC, are active tour leaders, so we decided to see where
they were leading tours this year. They were doing one in Scotland, so
we signed on. Simon said before we left that this tour would either
make him very fit or would kill him. Happily, the result was the
former. </p>
