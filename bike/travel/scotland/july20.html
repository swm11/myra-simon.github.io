<h1> Scotland bike tour: Day 7 (Saturday, July 20)</h1>

<b>Lots of pics of this day of the tour are <a

<p> The tour was officially over, but we weren't heading back home until Monday
night. There isn't a train back on Saturday night, and the bike spaces for
the Sunday night train were already taken up by Sue, Neil, and Greta. There
are 6 bike spaces available on the train north but only 3 heading south:
the other spaces are taken up by seafood being transported to London
restaurants. So we'd booked ourselves in for the Monday night train. </p>

<p> Sue & Neil had arranged another night's accommodation for the five of us in
Strathpeffer, about 25 miles away from Inverness via the most direct route.
Simon and I wanted to take it easy after the strains of yesterday, while
the other three were fit enough not to need it, so we told them that we
would make our own way there. </p>

<p> It was raining very lightly after breakfast wen we set out. The first thing
on the agenda was to check out the noise my bike was making. It sounded
suspiciously like the noise a broken bearing might make, so I suspected
that it was either one of my pedals or my bottom bracket. I strongly
suspected the former since the pedals were quite old, having been on other
bikes before this one. </p>

<p> The B&B lady recommended a shop called Bikes of Inverness. We went there
and the shop guy quickly diagnosed a shot left pedal. I would need new
pedals. Well, no problem, so I got some new ones (Shimano double sided
clipless pedals as before) and got them put on. We even got our tires
inflated to the proper pressure before heading on. </p>

<p> We went west out of Inverness. Our plan was to do some sightseeing along
the way as we rode to Strathpeffer. Our first stop was Moniack Castle,
which turned out be a semi-fortified country house built in the mid 1500s.
Much more interesting was the fact that it now houses a winery. Now grapes
don't grow in Scotland as it's too cold, so the wines were made from
everything except grapes, much of which grew right on the state. There were
wines made from silver birch sap, elderflowers, plums, black cherries,
honey (mead) and sloes (sloes are a kind of tiny plum that is used to give
sloe gin its pinkish color) amongst others. We samples all the wines and
many of the jams and jellies they also had there and went on a tour of the
winery. The small scale of it was pretty amusing: here's the little machine
that Joan uses to put glue on the back of the labels before carefully
placing them on the bottles, here is where Ewan carefully stacks the
bottles for ageing. Back in the shop we decided that the wines were good
enough that we selected a case and arranged them to be shipped to us in
Cambridge. </p>

<p> While we were in the winery, Simon complained that his right knee
was really hurting him, so we decided to take it as easy as we could
for the rest of the day. The rain had stopped by this time so at least
the riding was pleasant. </p>

<p> Back on our bikes, we rode a few miles to get to Beauly, where we had
lunch. There I looked around in a gift shop and found a little souvenir for
myself: stained glass in a Celtic knot pattern. We had a quick look at the
semi-ruined priory before headed onwards. </p>

<p> Again we were on our bikes for a very short time: we rode just a couple of
miles to the Glen Ord Distillery just outside of Muir of Ord. We went on a
tour of this: you can't go to Scotland, pass by dozens of distilleries, and
not take a tour of any of them. </p>

<p> This was as much large-scale and automated as the Moniack winery was small
scale and done by hand. We saw the large stainless steel mash tun where the
sugars are extracted from the barley, the cooler where yeast is added, the
dozen huge vats where the liquid ferments, the six huge copper stills where
the alcohol is evaporated and condensed, and a tiny fraction of their
storage space, where the proto-whiskey sits around for 12 years in sherry
or bourbon casks. Back at the shop they gave us small samples. I had one
sip of mine and gave the rest to Simon: I don't like strong alcohols. Simon
liked it so much that he bought a bottle to take home. </p>

<p> Finally we got back on the bikes an as it was already 4:30, we decided to
head straight for the B&B. Just as we were pulling into Strathpeffer, the
heavens opened. We pedalled on. I noticed a street sign for the road our
B&B was on,, so we went up it (I mean UP, it was a very steep, but
thankfully short, climb) to get to our B&B. The others, of course, had
already arrived. </p>

<p> The B&B man (the husband of the house) told us that there would be a show
of Scottish culture that evening, with a pipe (bagpipes) and drum (snares
and one bass) band and some highland dancing, that evening at 8:30. So
after a mediocre dinner at one of the hotels, we crossed the street to the
car park of the local shops and watched and listened to the Strathpeffer
pipe and drum band do their thing. They marched as they played, striding up
and down the car park. </p>

<p> After they'd played a selection of tunes, a fellow in a green jacket and
tartan trousers announced that there would be some highland dancing. Neil
thought it looked like the guy from our B&B: it was hard to tell as we'd
only seen him for a little bit, and the announcer was fairly far from us.
There were two groups of dancers: little girls, and big girls, all very fit-
looking and attractive. They would alternate doing dances such as the sword
dance (where the feet go in the spaces marked out by the intersection of
two swords) and the Highland Fling. They were accompanied by one of the
pipers from the band. </p>

<p> After about a half dozen dances the girls left the stage n the band came
back. We'd seen enough of them so we headed back to the B&B. Later the B&B
man came in, saw us all in the lounge, and said that we'd missed the
proceedings. No, we were there, we said, and we told him we'd enjoyed the
show. </p>

<p> Strathpeffer  was a Spa town in the Victorian age, with people coming from
all over to "take the waters". This seems to have been be a particularly
British thing to do at that time: they thought that smelly mineral springs
had some kind of curative effect. Or maybe they just liked soaking in the
hot water! Who knows. </p>

<p> It is a very nice looking little town. There are all sorts of interesting
looking buildings, most of them in good repair. The lamp posts are
particularly nice, painted green with gold highlights, and with flowers and
thistles picked out in different colors at the top near the bulbs. There
seem to be a nice collection of crafts shops, but they weren't open when we
were there. </p>

<p> Miles for today: 25. </p>
