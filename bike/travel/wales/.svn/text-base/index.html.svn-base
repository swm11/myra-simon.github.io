<p>Last night I loaded up my BOB (trailer) bag with all the stuff on
the list I'd been creating for the past week. Soon I discovered it
wouldn't all fit. What to leave behind? The tent was the obvious
choice: along with the Thermarest ad sleeping bag it was a significant
contributer to the volume ad weight of stuff I'd tried to fit in the
bag. Without that stuff, the bag closed just fine.</p>

<p>This morning I didn't set the alarm clock (so got up late) did a
bit of final packing, ate a big breakfast, posed for some photos,
kissed Simon goodbye, and headed out. It was 10:30am. Ooops.</p>

<p>I wanted to get from Cambridge to the Forest of Dean in two
days. The nearest youth hostel to the midpoint was in Charlbury, an
estimated 100 mile from Cambridge. Not what I wanted to do for my
first day towing the trailer, but it seemed to be necessary. The only
problem was: given that I was pulling a heavy trailer I'd be slowed
down alot. Would I actually make it to the youth hostel before it
closed at 10pm?</p>

<p>I started off riding pretty slowly, and it started to look like I
wouldn't make it. But at about the 50 mile point something clicked and
I started riding much faster, and I made up for lost time. By mile 85 I
was dropping off again, but there was no problem: I had plenty of
time. I pulled in about 9:15, having ridden 95 miles. They had plenty of
rooms available for tonight, but they were fully booked with school
groups both last night and tomorrow night!</p>

<p>I spoke to Simon and he asked me about the rain. Evidently there was
quite a storm at his parents, who live just north of here. I was
lucky, only getting a light rain a couple of time during the day.</p>

<a name="day2"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 2 (Monday 10-July)</h2></font>

<p>Rain, rain, go away s what I was thinking a good deal of today. It
was sprinkling as I left the youth hostel, then gradually built up
into a major rain.</p>

<p>I made it into Stow-on-the-Wold (mile 15 for today) still warm,
even if not very dry. in Stow I got the Tourist Info Centre to book me
a B&amp;B, got some money from Barclay bank, and mailed some stuff home to
lighten my load. I decided that James Clvel who always writes such
thick books, is not appropriate reading material for a bike holiday. I
also sent back my radio and the East Anglia map.</p>

<p>Coming out of Stow I was impressed at how pretty the Cotswalds are,
despite the rain. At on point I was cycling up a hill (very slowly as
you might expect) and saw a deer munching the roadside foliage. Now
this is a common sight in the US, but not where I live: there are no
deer near Cambridge. Eventually it saw me and ran away.</p>

<center><p>
<img hspace=5 align=center width=500 height=147 src="woburn-c-sm.jpg">
<br clear=all>
<i>deer at Woburn</i>
</p></center>

<p>Which reminds me of my favorite animal sighting of yesterday, which I
forgot to mention. Going past the Woburn Safari  Park I saw lots of
deer. Evidently they have a herd there. The coolest thing was that there
was a collection of stags, all with very impressive antlers. I stopped
to watch them a bit. I took a couple of piccies, but since the camera
has a wide-angle lens (35mm) they will look much smaller than they
really were.</p>

<p>Coming into Cheltenham (mile 30) the rain finally stopped.  I spent
some time and money in a petrol station tore eating a sandwich and
warming up.</p>

<p>I have found that it seems much easier to find dark Bounty bars
(chocolate bars with coconut in the middle) here. I Cambridge I can
usually only find the milk chocolate ones. So guess what I've been
eating in addition to cereal bars, malt loaf, and raisins?</p>

<p>I skirted Gloucester, glad that it was finally flat, and headed for
the Forest of Dean. And discovered (mile 50) that the FoD is NOT
flat. It is very not flat... The last 10 miles were painful, but
finally I pulled in to my B&amp;B for a hot shower and mugs of
tea. Now just need to find a place to eat!</p>

<hr>

<a name="day3"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 3 (Tuesday 11-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today was mostly a rest day. It started out very rainy, and I
didn't have much enthusiasm for cycling in the forest in the rain. So
I decided to play tourist.</p>

<p>I put off leaving the B&amp;B, only heading out when the landlady left
to run her craft shop down the road. It was sprinkling as I headed
towards the tourist info centre. It took me a long time to find it,
and I found a bike shop first. I thought it would be useful to have a
different pair of shorts (all mine are the same and have the seams in
the same place) so I walked in and asked if they had any good quality
womens shorts. "We have just this pair" they said, and they were
indeed good quality and they fit. And they were only 20 quid!
Bargain.</p>

<p>Finally finding the tourist office I got directions to some
touristy things and bought a map of the forest.</p>

<p>First destination was Clearwell Caves, site of very long running
(2000 years ago until 1940s) iron mining operation. It was very good,
mainly because we had a fab guide - he's a genuine FoD freeminer who
spent most of his life mining coal. He was able to tell us what all
the machinery did, and tell stories of the miners and their
lives. Tops.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=right width=300 height=259 src="puzzlewood-sm.jpg">

<p>Next was Puzzle Wood, a very old forest with large mature trees
(lots of oaks) and moss and ferns on the floor. It was dark, damp,
deep green and brown, and very beautiful. They liven up your visit by
putting things for you to find - two bridges, two lookouts, two dead
ends. The crisscrossing trails makes it impossible for you to keep
your bearings, so despite the fact that the area is very small it's
quite a challenge to find the stuff. I only found one bridge and dead
end!</p>

<p>When I left it was sunny. I went back to the B&amp;B. I had left out
back my spare tires and pump, so I swapped the slicks for knobbies and
headed for the forest. I then realized how ideal my B&amp;B was - in
Coalway, exactly on the west edge of the forest, near the best cycle
trails. I went to the cycle centre, asked for advice on where to ride,
and headed off. There is an MTB skills area where I set up the camera
on a tripod and used the self timer to take piccies of myself... I
found a great downhill - just on the edge of my capabilities. Then
after some riding around I found some excellent singletrack signed
with green arrows. I don't know if MTBs were supposed to ride there,
but plenty had and the track was ideal for it - ridable in most
places, but with some really tricky bits to hone your skills (and
occasionally make you push a bit!)</p>

<p>Then back to the B&amp;B for a shower, and to the pub for a chicken
curry where I'm writing up this email. Tiny computers are fun!</p>

<p>Total distance for today: 16 miles. I said today was mostly a rest
day!</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 4 (Wednesday 12-July)</h2></font>

<p>I'm finally in Wales! </p>

<p>The day didn't start off too well, as I tried to write the B&amp;B lady a
cheque and discovered that I was writing her a dollars cheque instead
of a sterling cheque! I'd brought the wrong cheque book. Silly me. Anyway,
had barely enough money to pay her in cash, and I hit the money
machine out of town.</p>

<p>The trip here (Forest of Dean to Cardiff) was pretty uneventful:
very little rain, no headwinds, even the roads were good. Cycling from
Chepstow to Newport I thought: hooray for the M48! Of course cyclists
can't use motorways, but all the cars choose to use that, leaving the
old A48 for me. It was a broad, smooth road that avoided major hills,
and had very little traffic. Ideal for cycling.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=left width=350 height=269 src="transporter-sm.jpg">

<p>I got a bit lost in Newport, as my maps weren't very detailed, but
a friendly local set me on the right route. As I cycled along the
River Usk I saw a tall girdered structure stretching across the
river. Some sort of heavy duty crane, I thought. Then, to my surprise,
I saw a little cage with cars on it, suspended beneath it, going
across the river! I had found the Newport transporter bridge. It was
built in 1900 as an alternative to more normal sorts of bridges which
didn't work because of the very tall ships that came through and the
extreme range of tide heights. It's now a listed building (which
basically means it must be preserved), and continues to operate with
extremely low tolls (50p for cars, pedestrians and bikes for free) as
a tourist attraction. Sadly, I had already crossed the Usk, so there
was no excuse to use it. Still I watched it for a bit, never having
seen anything like it.</p>

<p>Animal sighting of the day: a hedgehog rooting in the weeds on the
edge of the A48. I told it that it was a nocturnal critter, and that
it should go back to bed.</p>

<p>I'm staying this night and tomorrow night with David Owens an his
family. I met David through a cycling newsgroup, when he bought my
Thudbuster suspension seatpost. They took me out to dinner
tonight. Tomorrow I'll go riding with a couple of David's friends, and
tomorrow evening we'll check out Cardiff Bay and go see Chicken Run,
the new Nick Park movie.</p>

<p>Total distance today: a bit over 50 miles.</p>

<a name="day5"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 5 (Thursday 13-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today I went for a ride with a couple of friends of David Owens (my
host in Cardiff). The plan was to catch a train up to the hills and
ride back. Roger, who lives across the road, picked me up at 9:30 to
take me to the train station. Unfortunately I was filing my Camelbak
bladder at the time and didn't her the doorbell. When he'd finally
knocked loud enough for me to hear it was 9:35 and he was worried
about making it to the station on time.</p>

<p>We headed out and soon I noticed that my lower back was wet. Ooops
either the top of the bladder wasn't closed well enough, or the hose
wasn't connected correctly at the bottom. Either way we were short of
time and I'd have to wait until we got to the train station to sort it
out. The top of my shorts got wet. Then the bottom. Then I felt these
little drips down my leg. I pedalled on behind Roger. Finally we got
to the station and met Danny, and I quickly took off my pack and
figured out the problem: the zip lock at the top of the bag hadn't
locked properly, so water was sloshing out. I closed it up, and the
was left with a wet bum and back. Wonderful.</p>

<p>On the train I sat in several locations, letting the cloth seats
soak up some of the water. I was still quite damp when we left the
train at Treherbert, but I dried out eventually as we rode. First we
went up a small A-road, then we took Sustrans route 47 for a
while. Despite the fact that Roger had been on the route before, we
still went off it twice because it wasn't very well signposted. Other
than that it was an enjoyable route, mainly a wide dirt road with lots
of loose rocks. I got a pinch flat along here: I still had my slick
tires instead of the knobblies. I hadn't swapped them over because the
other guys had slicks as well.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch (sandwiches) in a tiny village consisting of
one pub and one church - no houses! From there we took a tiny road
into Pontypridd where I discovered that my rear tire was flat again!
We stopped to sort it out. Turns out I had some sidewall damage. I got
out my Park super patches but the paper backing for the plastic
patches had gotten damp and was sticking to the patch! Luckily one of
the guys had some conventional patches so we fixed both tire and tube,
and I was again on my way.</p>

<p>From there we followed the Taff Trail (constructed on old railway
lines) to Cardiff, total distance for the day about 40 miles.</p>

<p>This evening David's, his two kids and I headed to the docks area to
see the movie Chicken Run, which we all enjoyed.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I head off towards Brecon. I have really enjoyed my stay in
Cardiff and the warmth shown me by the Owens family. They made me feel
at home.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day6"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 6 (Friday 14-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today I rode from Cardiff to Brecon. From Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil
(which everyone calls Merthyr) I rode along the A4054, another A-road
made very nice for cycling by a much larger road going the same way
(in this case, the A470) and attracting the cars away. If I weren't
towing the trailer I could have taken the Taff Trail that we used
yesterday, but there are quite a few motorcycle barriers that are
annoying to get around with just a bike and would be bloody difficult
with a trailer.<p>

<p>However in Merthyr I wanted to pick up the Taff Trail mainly to go
over some very cool viaducts - old train bridges spanning valleys and
rivers. David and Roger didn't quite remember how to get to the
viaducts and suggested that I ask at the local bike shop, which they
remembered the way to very well (strange that). I found the bike shop
and the fellow there was very helpful, telling me how to get there and
giving me a map of the Taff Trail. I mentioned that my brake were
feeling a bit spongy, and quickly he had his allen keys out and was
adjusting them. When I worried that the tire on my BOB was a bit soft,
out came the pump. Of course, I had to buy something after that. I got
three energy bars, a small tube of grease (always handy) and a set of
my favorite Zefal tire levers.</p>

<p>I found the track leading to the viaducts easily, and went over the
first one. The one problem was the cursed motorcycle barriers. I had
to yank and lift and slide the bike and trailer to get them around. At
the third barrier by a churchyard a couple of friendly locals helped
me through. I'm glad that I have no problem understanding Welsh
accents; it would be embarrassing if I couldn't understand the local
people, especially as they re so friendly to me.</p>

</table>

<p>Then it was smooth sailing on a well-surfaced gravelly track. The
track joined the road, and I followed the road as far as the Talybont
reservoir, ignoring the Taff Trail as it did loops away from the
road. At the foot of the Talybont reservoir I rejoined  the TT, and
coasted for miles. OK I didn't really cost, I pedalled some to keep up
my speed, but I could have coasted slowly if I'd wanted to. I turned
left at Talybont-on-Usk (yup, the same river I crossed two days ago in
Newport, about 30 miles upstream) , leaving the TT for good. Then it
was only a few miles to my B&amp;B for the night giving a total of 43
miles for the day.</p>

<p>I had a shower, and the B&amp;B owners let me cook some Ramen noodles in
their kitchen, so I didn't have to eat alone in a pub tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I go to the Neuadd Arms hotel, hopefully arriving by 2pm,
when they are running the MTB bog snorkeling world championships.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day7"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 7 (Saturday 15-July)</h2></font>

<p>My route today was through Brecon, over some mountains, and on into
Llanwtryd Wells, home of the Neuadd Arms hotel and the MTB bog
Snorkelling World Championships.</p>

<p>My B&amp;B last night was right next to a canal, so I figured I'd
cycle along the canal into Brecon. This morning I roused myself up
early, had breakfast, and was on my way by 9:05. I set off along the
canal in what I thought was the right direction, but after a few
minutes I paused. Was this the right direction? I was cycling into the
sun, so heading east. Picturing the map, Brecon was to the left of my
B&amp;B, and left is east so I was all right. I kept going.</p>

<p>The smooth gravelled surface of the canal towpath gave way to
narrow occasionally muddy singletrack, which required a fair bit of
concentration given my slick tires and the trailer. Also I kept on
encountering walkers, which meant had to slow way down, smile, and ask
to get by (I do my best to be positive PR for MTBing).</p>

<p>Then the towpath was closed for repair and a detour map showed how
to get around the close section. Except that the map was very
confusing, as they'd drawn it with south at the top. Anyway I followed
the detour onto a road and was tooling along when I fund myself in
front of a Welcome to Talybont-on-Usk sign. Talybont?? I went through
that yesterday. Then it all came to me: left on the map is west, not
east, and the detour map was drawn the right way, with north on
top. I'd gone the wrong way. I turned around, passing all the walkers
who were now along the road.</p>

<p>This time I stuck to the road getting to Brecon, except or a bit at
the end, when you had the choice of a big highway or the canal. I
found a sign pointing to Brecon along the canal, and checked that this
sign pointed west, away from the sun, before I took it.</p>

</table>

<p>I found my way through Brecon all right and headed out and up. And
up. And the down then alot more up. At the top was a big Ministry of
Defense firing range, along with lots of sheep. From the top it was a
fast ride down and from there along the valley to Llanwrtyd
Wells. Arriving in town I saw a sign announcing the bog snorkeling
and some neon yellow arrows with BOG written on them. I followed the
arrows and found the bog.</p>

<p>[In my diary for July 15th I described the bog snorkelling event,
but now it has its own <a href="../../bog-snork.html">Web page</a>.]</p>

<p>After the festivities I went to the hotel, checked in, and had a
shower. I ran into some guys from MBR (a MTB magazine) who are here
scouting routes, and they were happy to have me ride with them
tomorrow. So it looks like I'll have some company for my first day's
riding here. I swapped my tires for knobblies in anticipation.</p>

<p>Today's distance: 34 miles.</p>

<a name="day8"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 8 (Sunday 16-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today I went MTBing with Tom Hutton, MBR routes editor, and his
riding buddy Tim Salveson whom I met in the hotel bar last night. Our
route, which Gordon Green (owner of the Neuadd Arms hotel that I'm
staying in) suggested, took in the Crychan Forest south of Llanwrtyd
Wells. The day was sunny and reasonably warm, and the guys were good
company. They were faster than I was up the hills, but they slowed
down to let me catch up.</p>

</table>

<p>The route was largely smoothish forest roads, but there was one
great track, an old Roman Road with just the native rock for a
surface. It had some nice dropoffs and looks like it would present a
real challenge for a climb. They were exploring the route for
inclusion in the magazine, so if you see an MBR (Mountain Bike Rider)
route starting in Llanwrtyd Wells in the near future, that's the one I
was on.</p>

<p>My legs ached a bit, so I decided to call it a day after getting back
to the hotel. After all, I have a week here, no need to do it all at
once.</p>

<p>I've stocked up on maps (OS explorer bought from the small grocery
store across the street) and bought a cycle routes guide. Tomorrow I
will start checking out the routes in the guide.</p>

<p>Total distance for today: 22 miles, mostly off-road.</p>

<br clear=all>

<hr>

<a name="day9"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 9 (Monday 17-July)</h2></font>

<p>Another warm sunny day. Today I rode one of the routes that been
way marked by the CTC. I did route 4, in Irfon Forest north of
Llanwrtyd Wells. The first part was pretty boring, mostly fire
roads. The scenery was very nice, especially on such a fine day but
there wasn't much going on under my wheels.</p>

<p>The first real decent was a doozy though. Steep, narrow, a few
dropoffs, trees all around. Lovely. I tried taking some piccies of
myself (using the self timer) going through a little streamlet, but in
my haste to get into the picture I crashed in the little stream,
getting very wet and mucky, and bashing my right elbow. I picked up my
bike, scraped the worst off myself with handfuls of grass, wiped my
elbow with an antiseptic wipe (I was glad I'd remembered to put the
little first aid kit in my bag) and vowed not to take any more piccies
of technical bits.</p>

<p>The second half of the ride was much better than the first - hard
steep climbs (instead of wimpy middle-ring fire road climbs) narrow
rutted tracks, descents with little dropoffs, stream fordings. I rode
much more carefully and didn't have any falls, although the riding was
much more technical.</p>

<p>When got back to the hotel I'd only done about 16 miles and it was
too early to call it a day. So I went exploring - I checked out a
bridleway that lead out of town towards the forest. The first part was
awful (too broken up by horses to be ridable) but the rest was good,
though reasonably hard riding.</p>

<p>Coming back from exploring I felt pretty tired, and I had done 20
hilly off-road miles, so I called it a day and went for a shower.</p>

<p>I found a couple in the bar who turned out to be cycle touring, so
I chatted with them for a bit. They are staying in the hotel across
the road, so I will go over there tomorrow before they head out to
have a look at their bike - evidently it's a full suspension MTB
tandem! I've never seen one before... I'd liked to have seen it this
evening, but evidently in that hotel they aren't so free with the bike
shed key. Here it lives on the hotel desk.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I think I will explore more of the CTC routes, since the
first one was so good.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 10 (Tuesday 18-July)</h2></font>

<p>This morning started out with me admiring a tandem. It was owned by
the couple I'd met in the bar last night. It was a bright red KHS bike
with 4-bar suspension at the rear and triple clamp Pace forks at the
front, shod with MTB semi slicks. And with a little blue plastic
squeaky toy on the handlebars, partially negating its trail-killer
looks.</p>

<p>I had breakfast with a fellow named Pete whom I'd met yesterday when
he rolled in on his Marin after doing the same route that I had, No 4
in Irfon Forest. He remarked that he thought he'd been following some
fresh tracks...</p>

<p>As it turned out, we were planning on doing the same route (No 5,
Mynydd Trawsnant), and as we started at the same time, we rode it
together. He had to wait for me after all the difficult bits, but he
seemed to enjoy the company, as did I. About halfway through the ride
the sole of his right shoe came off, leaving the cleat permanently
attached to his pedal, and after that he didn't get too far in front
of me.</p>

<p>We got lost at one point, where the directions on the route card
weren't as detailed as they could be, the little sketch map was very
sketchy, and markers on the ground were nonexistent. It was only with
the use of my map and compass that we figured out where we were and
how to get back on the route. Soon (it was mostly downhill) we were
back in Llanwrtyd Wells. </p>

<p>Pete packed and headed out, while I debated what to do. It was too
early to call it a day, but I really didn't feel like riding any more,
despite only having gone about 17 miles. I decided to play tourist and
check out the local woolen mill, which was just out of town. I took a
shower, put on civilian clothes, and headed out. It wasn't quite the
tourist attraction I had hoped for, it was just full of weaving
machines making tartans.I suppose the machines were somewhat
interesting, but I would have liked to have seen how the sheep's wool
got onto the spools of threads. Oh, well.</p>

<p>So I came back with only a bit over 19 miles done for today. The route
only had one really challenging part, most of the rest was either road
or boring forest fire road.</p>

<p>Hanging on the wall of the pub was a long route (30 miles) that
looked like a good challenge, so I marked it with pink highlighter on
my map. As I ordered a pre-dinner beer a fellow at the bar recommended
the Doethie Valley to me. Where's that, I asked, and he went to show
me on the map. He was quite surprised to find that the route he was
going to recommend had pink highlighter on it! Well, it must be fate,
so that's what I'll do tomorrow.</p>


<hr>

<a name="day11"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 11 (Wednesday 19-July)</h2></font>

<p>The weather continues to be fabulous - warm and sunny, clear blue
skies with the odd fluffy white cloud. It's been like this ever since
I arrived here on Saturday. This sort of weather is very rare in Wales
(and in the rest of Britain for that matter) so I'm sure I'm getting
the best summer has to offer, right here and now.</p>

<p>I had a great ride today. I followed the route I'd marked out
yesterday (the one on the wall) which was also recommended me by the
guy at the bar (whom I've learned is a walking guide). Basically it
went north out of Llanwrtyd Wells on road for awhile then went west on
easy forest tracks, then went south on a bridleway for aways, then
back east to town on forest road and tarmaced roads. The total
distance for the ride was 30 miles.</p>

<p>I felt like having bit of a challenge, so I replaced some of the
first road bit with some off-road which involved a steep challenging
climb then a technical downhill which I'd done on Monday as part of
the Irfon Forest ride. Heading west on the forest tracks was easy
enough, as I had copied own the route instructions as well as
highlighting my map.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=left width=375 height=250 src="doethie-sm.jpg">

<p>I cut off the top left of the official route, following the
suggestion of the walking guide, and so rode on an old drovers road
over some hills. Coming to the last bit of the drovers road, close to
where I would rejoin the published route, I rounded a corner and
suddenly the whole Doethie Valley was spread out in front of me in the
afternoon sun. It was amazingly beautiful. There were no buildings in
sight, only grass and ferns in all different shades of green, and of
course lots of sheep. I paused for quite a while admiring the view
before descending.<p>

<p>The southbound bridleway I joined went along the left side of Afon
Doethie, a fair ways above the stream. It was narrow and had a few
tricky bits (rocks and bog) here and there. I was extra cautious, as I
realized that I was the only person in this entire valley, and if I
got hurt no one would be around to help. Despite this I still managed
to fall off the track to the right, down the steep side. Luckily the
part I landed on was boggy grass, but I slid for a short distance on
my right elbow, which hasn't completely healed from Monday's crash in
the little stream. It hurt quite a bit, but I knew there was nothing
seriously wrong, so I carried on. After all, what else was I to do?</p>

<p>After I got to the end of the southbound bit I headed east along
the road, then went through forest back to town. This last bit was the
same route that Pete and I had taken yesterday and gotten lost
on. This time, however, I knew my way. I started the long, long climb,
and I ran out of water just before I reached the top. No worries, I
thought, because once I get to the top, it's downhill on fire road all
the way back to Llanwrtyd Wells. Well, that's a bit of an
exaggeration: there was a tiny section of uphill bridleway after the
downhill fire road, and there was a bit over a mile of mostly flat
road back to town, but it all went by pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I pulled into town having done 31 hilly, mostly off-road miles. I was
very tired, and shoved the bike in the garage without washing it. I
took a shower, had an early dinner, and then I had the energy to wash
the bike.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day12"></a> <font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 12 (Thursday
20-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today wasn't quite as sunny as it has been; a few clouds have
rolled in tone down the sun. Still plenty bright and warm, just less
direct sun, making the climbs a bit easier. And now that I look out my
window there isn't a cloud in the sky so maybe it'll be back to
blindingly bright tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be my last full day here. I asked the owners for
advice of where I should go next and they suggested a bike trail
heading north. Sounds good to me. So tomorrow I'll stop by the tourist
info office (which is across the street, this *is* the smallest town
in Britain after all) for details tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today's riding was a mixed bag. I'm trying to sort out a route for
GoFar (online MTB mag, <a href="http://www.gofar-mtb.com/">http://www.gofar-mtb.com/</a>), and I
had a nice one all figured out on the map. I only needed to make sure
it would be all right in real life. The first part went fine, and I
knew the last bit would be OK since it's part of one of the CTC marked
routes. But the bridleway that connected them together just didn't
exist on the ground. I struggled for awhile trying to find the
bridleway, and then to construct an alternative using forest roads,
but it just didn't work.</p>

<p>In frustration I went back on the road to the hotel and looked for
Gordon (Green, owner of the hotel) to get him to suggest a
route. Which, in all honesty, is what I should have done in the first
place. He pointed out a few nice places to ride so I'll check these
out tomorrow. But for today, so I wouldn't feel that the day was
wasted, I went off again and rode a few of the bridleways nearest the
hotel. One involved a ford across a not-so-small stream, so I took off
my socks and shoes and carried the bike across. I sat on the far bank,
letting my feet dry eating a cereal bar, and taking in the sunshine
before I headed back.</p>

<p>Did 26 miles in total today.</p>

<p>Hmmm, I just had a nice chat with a lady in the bar who's an avid
horsewoman, and she has recommended to me a variation on my original
route which sounds nice. So I guess I'll do that instead of using
Gordon's suggestions.</p>


<hr>

<a name="day13"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 13 (Friday 21-July)</h2></font>

<p>Today is my last full day in Llanwrtyd Wells. I've bought myself a
map of the Lon Las Cymru (the Welsh National Cycle Route) and will
head out on it tomorrow, heading roughly north.</p>

<p>Today was a scorcher. Sunny and very warm - the warmest day of an
entire week of great weather. On this day I was not doing something
sensible like sitting on the hotel verandah sipping cold drinks, I was
out plotting a route for <a href="http://www.gofar-mtb.com/">GoFar</a>.</p>

<p>I knew which route I should take, as the horsewoman at the bar last
night had suggested it. But sometimes finding the tracks on the ground
isn't so easy, even when you know the tracks exist.</p>

<p>I started out my ride by noticing that my brakes had gone mushy
again. I was about to tighten the cables one more time when I noticed
that the brake pads had worn enough that they were no longer aligned
with the rim. So I sorted that out, under the already hot morning sun,
before I even left the hotel car park.</p>

<p>The ride starts with a quick whiz down the main town road to pick
up a farm track bridleway. This track leads to a B&amp;B, so there are
frequent encouraging signs like "Yes, your car can make it up this
hill" and then in a bit "Told you!" I was slightly annoyed, because I
could have used some encouragement, but the signs were not for me.</p>

<p>As I trudged up, the sheep kept running away from me. Well, they'd
run a ways up the track, then stop and look at me to see if I was
still pursuing them. I steadily approached, and they'd run some
more. You'd think that with the number of walkers, bikers, horses, and
cars that go down the track the sheep would learn that the big nasty
beasts tend to stay on the track and that if they went into the fields
they'd be safe. I just don't think sheep are very smart.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=right width=350 height=260 src="mybytom-sm.jpg">

<p>The track left the farms and went into the woods, and then joined an
old Roman Road. I'd ridden this on my very first day here, with the
MBR route guys, so it was fitting that I rode here on my last day. I
like this track. In many places this is just bare rock, presenting a
rough surface for riding. It's especially challenging as a climb, and
I started the climb now. It seems that a week of riding over here has
improved my fitness; I made it to the top without putting my foot down
for the first time. </p>

<p>The Roman Road eventually levels out, then begins to drop. This bit
isn't quite as challenging as the part I climbed but I still took it
easy, not wanting to risk injury while riding alone.</p>

<p>After this I had a few miles of road to cover. On the map there are
bridleways here, but I wasted at least an hour yesterday looking for
them, and both Gordon and the horsewoman verified that indeed, they
don't exist. At least the roads were small and lightly traveled, and
I got to go under a large viaduct.</p>

<p>Finally it came time to pick up another bridleway. The map showed
me joining the bridleway before I crossed a bridge over a small
stream. I found a track, but it soon petered out, and it didn't look
very much like the one I was supposed to take anyway (for one thing I
was in broadleaf trees instead of pines). Also according to my
compass, it was going east and I wanted to go north. But this was the
only track just before the bridge. I just didn't get it.</p>

<p>Eventually I gave up and decided that I would take an alternative, a
farm track on open land instead of a bridleway in the forest. So I
went further down the road and suddenly crossed another bridge! I was
startled, as the map only shows one bridge, but a closer look at the
map showed the tiny sliver of blue that the first bridge crossed. Ah,
that's it! I found my bridleway between the two bridges and climbed
into the forest.</p>

<p>The track was steep, wet, and loose, and my wheels kept slipping. I
walked until it levelled out some, then got back on the bike. I liked
this. It's good to have some not-quite-ridable bits on a route, as it
gives you something to aim for, a chance to improve.</p>

<p>At the top I joined a big forest track, then looked out for a
bridleway off to the left. I spotted a tiny track in about the right
place. It had horse tracks on it. Could this be it? A careful
examination of the map suggested it was, so I headed down, enjoying
the narrow rough track.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=left width=350 height=261 src="in-field-sm.jpg">

<p>At the bottom the bridleway went along a stream. But, not content to
stay on one side of it, it went across the stream, without benefit of
a bridge. Twice. Luckily the rocks weren't too slippery so I made
it. This track was nice, narrow and winding along flat fields. Riding
along in the warm afternoon sun I felt great. The peace was only
broken by the roar of a jet plane. I looked up to try to find it, but
saw nothing. Looking ahead of the sounds, though, I found it: a
dark-painted, pointy plane, clearly military. They had been a constant
feature of my stay in Llanwrtyd Wells, as there's an air base
nearby. Once while I was out riding I saw a big fat propeller plane
slowly lift itself over the hill in front of me. It was a Hercules,
was the consensus at the bar later.</p>

<p>Of course after the flat fields came the inevitable climb. And
climb I did, for two miles after I had re-entered the trees. Finally
came the payback: a fast forest road descent where I quickly lost all
my hard-earned altitude. A short technical bridleway descent and
climb, and I was back on the road, 1 1/4 miles from Llanwrtyd
Wells.</p>

<p>But it wasn't over yet! I'd noticed a route that would take me
off-road for part of the the way back. I followed it and it involved -
guess what? - another climb, very steep and technical in places. Good
stuff. And then the final descent on a rooty bridleway, and then it
was a quick trip back into town.</p>

<p>Coming in I passed a shop that had bananas in the window, and I
suddenly craved one. There was nothing to stop me, so I bought two,
and a Ribena, and sat on the hotel verandah under the shade of an
umbrella, drinking and eating, and reflecting on the day's riding.</p>

<p>Total distance for me today: 22 miles. The route I worked out is 18
miles long.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 14 (Saturday 22-July)</h2></font>

<p>Yesterday evening I was busy writing up the directions for the
GoFar route so I didn't have time to pack. So I spent quite a bit of
time this morning putting my gear together, as well as posting back to
Simon stuff I didn't need, including maps for south Wales (I'm now in
mid-Wales and heading north), one of my bike locks, and my GT polo
shirt I got for bog snorkeling.</p>

<p>It was 11:30 when I finally got the BOB hooked up to the bike and got
going, following the Sustrans (an organization that builds bike paths)
Lon Las Cymru route, the off-road version. It started out following a
road I'd ridden many times over the last week. I saw the ends of all
the bridleways I'd ridden, and I thought of the great rides I'd done.</p>

<img hspace=5 align=right width=350 height=226 src="irfonv-sm.jpg">

<p>The road followed the Irfon River (really a little stream at that
point) north out of Abergwesyn, and this was really
spectacular. Actually it reminded me alot of the Doethie Valley which
I'd taken in on the route on the wall of the bar at the Neuadd. Except
that instead of being completely devoid of people (besides myself) it
had a few cars going along it very slowly, enjoying the view, and
stopping frequently (pulling off the extremely narrow road) to get a
better look.</p>

<p>After this was the Devil's Staircase, a hill with a 25% grade in
places. I didn't even try to ride, and it was a very hard push.</p>

<p>Shortly after this I left the road and joined a byway, a rutted
rough dirt road. This was a bit of a challenge with the trailer. At
one point I was suppose to leave the byway and join a forest track,
but I didn't find the turn off. I did see a track turning off at more
or less the right place, but it ended in a fence. I found myself
fording the stream that the byway ran next to, once, twice, again, and
pushing my bike and the trailer around big boggy sections. This isn't
a Sustrans route, I thought. I pulled out my detailed OS map and found
that indeed I was still on the byway, but it was a much shorter route
than the official route. Great! I kept going.</p>

<table border=0 align=left cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td><img width=350 height=222 src="fords-sm.jpg"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>!@^*$;& fords</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>And I kept fording the stream. At first I was being careful and
pushing the bike through the edge of the fords where they were
shallower (yes I got wet feet, but it was warm and sunny yet again so
this wasn't a problem). Eventually I gave up and just put the bike in
a low gear and rode right through. I was glad I'd left the knobbly
tires on the bike. Still, when puddles of unknown depth covered the
byway, I preferred to push the bike around rather than ride
through. Since the grass beside the byway was generally quite damp
this often involved hauling the bike and trailer through sticky
mud. This was real work, and I was going very slowly.</p>

<p>My OS map told me that the path I was on crossed the official path,
so when I came to an intersection with a wide, smooth forest track, I
verified (comparing real life to the map) that this was the right way,
and I took it. Finally the miles began to accumulate again even if
slowly.</p>

<p>When I finally hit tarmac again at mile 19 for the day, it was
4pm. I started to feel quite down having done so little distance. I
vowed to ride until 6pm, and then look for a B&amp;B.</p>

<p>I went through the tiny town with the big name of
Pontrhydfendigaid, then Ysbyty Ystwyth, and then I was supposed to
pick up another off-road bit. I debated giving it a miss. But, hey, it
was still warm and sunny, and it was only about 5pm, so I took the
off-road detour. I climbed and climbed and found myself on a
singletrack road, with little hillocks of bare grass and gorse bushes
(and sheep, of course) between me and the valley far
below. Beautiful. And I thought, where would I rather be? Nowhere, I
concluded, and I began to cheer up.</p>

<p>Suddenly I came to a gate in front of a farmyard. I didn't have a
nice detailed OS map of this area so I wasn't sure if I was supposed
to go through here. I saw a faded sign on the gate: no unauthorized
motor vehicles. Oddly enough, this made me feel welcome - the owner
obviously has no problem with non-motorized vehicles. I went through
the gate and saw on the other side of the farmyard another gate and a
sign: please keep to the track. OK, this is probably the right place.
I went through and found an old man walking toward me. I asked if I
was going in the right direction, towards Cwmystwyth. Or rather, I
pointed to the name of the town on the map and asked if I was going
towards that (to my embarrassment, I still can't reliably pronounce
Welsh place names). The fellow said, "Hold on I'll get my glasses" and
went back to the farm. When he came back, he confirmed I was in the
right place and then kept talking.</p>

<p>When I first saw him I wondered if perhaps he resented Sustrans
putting a national cycle route through his farmyard, but soon I
realized he probably quite liked it, as it gave him people to talk
to. He told me about the mansion across the valley that he used to
work in when he was young, about going off to the war in '44, about
how the patch of trees to the right used to be a big sheep field, and
how they'd have loads of sheep-shearers coming in, using hand-shears
(now they're powered by compressed air), how this year foxes got a
couple of his lambs... I hated to leave him, since he was obviously
happy to have someone to tell stories to, but I wanted to head on to
Devil's Bridge, which he said was the next town on the route with a
hotel or B&amp;Bs.</p>

<p>Finally I got under way an made it to Devil's Bridge. The hotel was
full, but the B&amp;B just up the road was empty, and only 17.50 a
night. My room is tiny, but I have exclusive (since I'm the only
guest) use of a sizeable sitting room, where I'm typing this
now. There's a stereo in the corner, which needed an extension cord
before it could be plugged in and turned on. I'm listening to a Welsh
radio station. I don't understand a word of Welsh but at least they're
playing good music (half Welsh stuff I've never heard before half good
old English-language rock-n-roll).</p>

<p>Oh, at a little park before the final descent into Devil's Bridge I
came across another biker who'd come the same way I did. He also
missed the turn from the byway, and realized at all the fords that he
wasn't on the right track. So he went back to the little turn-off I'd
seen, and had discovered that the fence across it was a cleverly
disguised gate! Oh well, at least I tested the waterproofness of my
BOB sack. It has passed with flying colors: everything is bone dry. I
just hope that the hub in the BOB is well sealed, since it definitely
went under water!</p>

<p>Total for today: 33 very hilly and occasionally very difficult
miles.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day15"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 15 (Sunday 23-July)</h2></font>

<p>This morning I played tourist by checking out the bridges at
Devil's Bridge. The first one was built in the 11th century by monks,
so the Welsh name for the place is Monk's Bridge (the English name
comes from the legend that the bridge was built by the devil). Right
above that is a 19th century (or was it 18th?) one built to carry
horse &amp; carriage traffic. Then on top of that is the bridge that's
used today which was built in the early 20th century. There are also
some waterfalls there but I contented myself with the bridges.</p>

<p>The weather started out cool, sunny, and windy (in my face for most
of the trip). Gradually it clouded over, but at least it stayed
dry. The whole day I wore a long-sleeve top over my usual coolmax
T-shirt.</p>

<p>Bike-wise, I continued to follow the Sustrans Lon Las Cymru
off-road route. This followed a small A-road out of Devil's Bridge,
then at Ponterwyd it took a tiny road heading off into the
mountains. This eventually turned into a rough, rocky dirt road, which
was a fair bit of a challenge with the BOB. I came to a ford and felt:
after yesterday, I can handle fords. So I started to ride across, but
unlike yesterday's rocks, the ones at the bottom of this stream were
slippery. The bike slid sideways. I landed on my feet and picked up
the bike as quickly as I could: the BOB bag is waterproof, but the
handlebar bag is not. I pushed the bike through the ford. Oh well, wet
feet again.</p>

<table vspace=5 hspace=5 border=0 align=left cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3>

<tr><td align="center">
<i>polytunnel bike shed at Corris YH</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Then the route turned onto a smooth forest track for a long
climb. However, when the track turned downhill it got much rougher. At
one point I was going down this steep track covered with loose
rocks. I cycled down this, but not all in one go. The bike would slide
out from under me, I'd land on my feet, let my heart settle down, and
I'd get on again.</p>

<p>Halfway down I saw the guy I'd met last night coming into Devil's
Bridge. We introduced ourselves: his name is Steve. We rode together
into Machynlleth, and he said he was going to the Centre for
Alternative Technology. I didn't have any plans, so I figured I'd go
along as well.</p>

<p>The CAT is meant to inspire people to live more sustainable by
cycling and taking public transport, recycling, putting more
insulation in their houses, generating electricity with wind and
water, etc. We wandered around there until it closed at 6pm, then
headed to the Corris youth hostel where he had a bed booked. Luckily
they had plenty of spaces, so that's where I'm staying tonight. It
seems to be a bit of a New Age youth hostel with candles on the
tables, crystals on shelves, mystical paintings, etc. Since I've now
joined the main Sustrans route (as opposed to the off-road one) and
we've met another biker doing the route in the opposite direction, so
we all went to the pub down the hill for dinner.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the phone (Vodafone) reception is good here. In
Llanwrtyd Wells it was intermittent; in Devil's Bridge it was
non-existent (which is why I didn't send out yesterday's report until
today); here it's great.</p>

<p>Total distance for today: 27 miles, what with the hills, off-road
bits, and tourism (CAT).</p>

under way Steve was going too, and we headed our separate ways: him to
the east to pick up the Lon Las Cymru off-road route, and me north to

<p>It seems that even the standard route can include some very rough
off-road. I started out from Corris this morning on a nice lightly
travelled road, which soon became a very steep smaller road, which
soon became an equally steep rough track with the occasional loose
rocks. It would have been a good challenging ride without the trailer,
but it was impossible with it. I hoped the way down was similar so I
could have a bit of fun, but it turned out to be a not very steep
smooth grassy track that I could have probably ridden up. Oh,
well.</p>

<p>I came into Dolgellau about lunchtime. By now the clouds had
cleared, and the very gray town (all the buildings are made of the
same gray stone) looked quite nice. I went past a bike shop and bought
some more brake pads as backups, and asked about routes. Soon, at my
request, the bike shop guy was highlighting my map with route ideas. I
looked at the result and thought: that's several days' riding
there. So I decided to stay.</p>

<p>I found a B&amp;B down the road and signed in. It was early and the
room wasn't ready, so I went for a walk: the Precipice Walk just out
of town which goes around a hill, fairly high up it. Simon and I had
done this before on our first holiday together 4 years ago, but it was
nice enough to do again.</p>

<p>After the walk I returned to the B&amp;B, had a shower, and got
some Chinese takeaway from the shop down the road.</p>

</p>Total distance for today: 17 miles with the bike, 2 or 3 on the
little walk.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 17 (Tuesday 25-July)</h2></font>

<p>When I woke up this morning it was raining lightly. I slipped out
the fire escape to check my bike. (My window opens onto the fire
escape leading to the back garden, and the bike is parked under the
fire escape.) It was getting a bit damp, so I moved it more into
shelter.</p>

<p>By breakfast the rain had stopped, so after breakfast I chose a
route and headed out. The start was really easy: west from Dolgellau
on the bike path along the Mawddach Estuary, then across the railway,
bike &amp; pedestrian bridge to Barmouth.</p>

<p>I felt very lethargic, so I took it easy, pedalling gently
along. At Barmouth I stopped to watch people fishing for crabs from
the docks and building sandcastles on the beach. I didn't feel much
like cycling. In fact the idea of sitting in the back garden of the
B&amp;B with a book and pot of tea appealed to me. But I'm a cyclist,
so I ride my bike. I'd probably feel guilty if I had an entire day of
rest.</p>

<p>The sun came out while I was in Barmouth, and that helped perk me
up. I headed north along the main coast road in the direction of
Harlech, but turned east, inland, at another Talybont (I passed
through Talybont-on-Usk on the way to Brecon on July 14th). This road
climbed, then turned into a good dirt road and kept climbing.</p>

<p>My highlighted (courtesy of the bike shop guy yesterday) route
showed that I needed to fork right at one point. I noted that another
track joined in from the left before my turn. As I rode along I
noticed a right fork, but as I hadn't seen the track on the left I
ignored it. Eventually it became obvious I had come too far. I looked
at the map for more clues. There was a patch of trees near where I
needed to make the turn. I went back and groaned when I discovered
that the track I'd noted but ignored was the one I needed. Oh,
well.</p>

<img align="right" width=375 height=201 src="bridge-sm.jpg">

<p>This track lead down to a neat little stone bridge, then steeply up
after this. I tried to ride this but ended up walking large
sections. I noted how much nicer it was to push just a bike up a steep
hill rather than a bike plus a loaded BOB. With just the bike, it's a
gentle walk as you guide your two-wheeled friend along beside
you. With the trailer it's a tremendous effort, involving lots of
pushing, shoving, and cursing.</p>

<p>Once I got to the top it was mostly downhill for two miles. This
was great fun. Then I joined a road and it was another 1.5 miles of
mostly downhill. They certainly have big hills in Wales! Then it was a
short flat ride back to Dolgellau.</p>

<p>Total distance for today: 30 miles.</p>

<p>I still feel a bit sleepy. My left shoulder is a bit tight, and
I've found that the B&amp;B lady does massage. Well, not the usual
sort of back massage, but Indian head massage, which involves a fair
bit of loosening of the shoulders as well. I'll see if I can get her
to fit me in a session before I go.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day18"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 18 (Wednesday 26-July)</h2></font>

<p>The B&amp;B lady did find time to do a head massage for me
yesterday. It seems the head massage is intended to be relaxing in the
stress-relieving sense, not in the loosening up of very knotted
muscles, which requires a deeper, more forceful massage. Oh, well. It
certainly left nice and was relaxing, but didn't help my tight
shoulder much.</p>

<p>Today my bike stayed under its fire escape shelter. It rained all
morning, and when it finally stopped raining after noon I didn't feel
like riding. I debated what to do while I had lunch. I finally decided
to go for a walk. I noticed that the Torrent Walk, another walk that
Simon and I had done four years ago, was very close to town so I
included that in a longer walk that took about three hours. So even if
I didn't ride my bike, at least I got some exercise.</p>

<p>After coming back I washed all my clothes in the Launderette across
the street an had fish & chips for dinner. Time to pack up now.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 19 (Thursday 27-July)</h2></font>

<p>Leaving Dolgellau this morning I followed the Sustrans Lon Las Cymru
north through the Coed-Y-Brenin forest. This is one of the alternative
routes; the main route goes along the west coast of Wales.</p>

<p>This section was actually ridable the entire way, unlike many of
the other sections I've been through. Eventually the route left the
forest and at Trawsfyndd went along the A470. This was very easy
riding, in comparison to the tiny roads that seemed to seek out the
hills and especially the off-road bits. It's plenty wide enough for
cars to pass easily, yet on the map for the route it says that this
section "involves some busy fast roads. Only recommended for
experienced cyclists". But there is no way to avoid it, at least on
this route (and the only way to avoid a similar road on the main route
is to ride on the beach, which sounds extremely difficult). And many
of the off-road sections are noted as for experienced cyclists only -
which I would agree with, as some are quite difficult.</p>

<p>All of this makes me wonder just who these Sustrans routes are
intended for. They are perfect for me, a very experienced, reasonably
fit cyclist with a good bike and decent navigational skills. I can
handle both the rough off-road and busier on-road sections, but your
novice cyclists won't feel confident on either. And yet on the map it
says that the stated goal of the National Cycle Network (which this is
a part of) when it's completed, is that it will be "safe for novice
cyclists, useful for helping to reduce congestion, and memorable for
visitors".</p>

<p>Unless they eliminate from the main route *all* the places that
they've marked for experienced cyclists only in both the on- and
off-road sections, I can't see this how this would be good for truly
novice cyclists.</p>

<p>As for "useful for helping to reduce congestion", ha! This is a
*very* difficult route. The hills, and the difficulty of some of the
off-road sections, reduced your speed greatly, to where it's hard to
do more than 30 miles a day. If you stay on road, and furthermore
choose small A-roads and B-roads, with the occasional small road to
connect them, you an easily go twice that distance in a day.</p>

<p>As far as "memorable for visitors", well I actually agree with
this. It is a difficult route, but very rewarding to an experienced
cycle-tourist such as myself.  Anyway, enough of grumble. Back to my
day...</p>

<p>I left the Lon Las Cymru just north of Llyn Trawsfyndd, where I
headed northeast towards Betws-Y-Coed, and the LLC heads northwest
towards Anglesey. I could have stayed on the A470 all the way to
Betws-Y-Coed, but I preferred the challenge of smaller roads that went
over the mountains. From Ffestiniog I took a couple of B-roads, then a
small unclassified road over the hills to the A5 just outside of
Betws-Y-Coed.</p>

<p>I debated trying to find a collection of small roads that would
take me into town avoiding the A5 (which I thought would be quite
busy). But there didn't seem to be too many cars so I decide to chance
it. After all it was only about a mile and a half to town. I needn't
have worried. It was downhill all the way. I was coasting along at
25mph, thus managing to not get too many cars behind me. I pulled over
once to let a car by, but that's all I needed to do.</p>

<p>I had a look at hotels and B&B as I came into town. I wanted a
place off the main road (the A5 still) so it would be quieter. I
spotted a road up a hill and checked it out. I found a B&B there, the
price was reasonable, and they had a room free. Sorted.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will go out riding in the Gwydyr Forest (the "coed" that
gives the town its name), and tomorrow evening Simon will join me
here. We'll probably do some walking over then next couple of days,
then we're off to Scotland for a wedding.</p>

<p>Total distance for today: about 38 miles.</p>

<hr>

<a name="day20"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 20 (Friday 28-July)</h2></font>

<p> Today I did a ride in the Gwydyr Forest. Yesterday I had asked the
guy in the local bike shop (which is a few houses down from where I'm
staying) where is good to ride, and he highlighted some tracks on the
forest map. </p>

<img align="right" width=350 height=281 src="byc-stream-sm.jpg">

<p> I headed off to find them, but just before I got into the forest I
found an outdoors shop. I can't resist them, so I went in for a
look. And I came out with a new lightweight red fleece for 12.50. </p>

<p> Then I had a look at the nice stream running by the shop and
finished off a roll of film. So I went back to the B&B to drop of the
fleece and pick up another roll of film. And again I set off in search
of the tracks. I first tried out a track that was close to one that
was highlighted on my map, but it wasn't close enough. The track was
completely unridable and I pushed my bike along it. </p>

<p> I was more successful with the second track I tried. At first it
was completely ridable, a steady climb up a pine-needled path. Then it
became very steep and rocky, but after a short stretch of this it
levelled out and became ridable again. When it finished on a fire
road, I thought, great, I'll have more of that! I went looking for
another bit and got quite confused: the fire roads on the ground
didn't seem to agree with my map. Or, perhaps more likely, the track
didn't really go where the highlighter said it went. </p>

<p> Eventually I located myself and went looking for a different piece
of highlighted track (I'd gone past the place I'd tried to find). I
found this one, and again it was good for riding. I went looking for
another bit that started near where that finished, but I couldn't see
where it started. So I picked another track an followed that one. This
went over a big hill a down to a lake. </p>

<p> By now I'd gone about 10 miles northeast of Betwys-Y-Coed.  This
lake (Llyn Crafnant) was surrounded by rugged looking hills, but one
of my highlighted tracks lead up a pass between them to head back
south. I found the highlighted path, and it lead to a very impressive
bit of rock. There was a big rectangular hole in the rock, and the
floor of the hole was occupied by a very deep pit. Perhaps it was an
entrance to an old mine. </p>

<p> After this, the track dwindled into just a sheep track clinging to
the side of a rocky hills. Hmmm. I looked at the OS map for more
info. Actually there were two tracks leaving the lake, and it seemed
like the bike shop guy had highlighted the wrong one. In an attempt to
avoid backtracking completely, I went straight down the side of the
hill, carrying my bike down a faint track over a mass of loose shale,
then pushing it through a sheep field. Finally I rejoined the right
track. </p>

<p> And it was getting quite late. I expected Simon to be arrive at
the B&B around 5 or 6 and it was already past 5:30. I knew he'd be
worried about me. Yet I was beginning to get tired, and I was very
aware of being alone in a remote place, so I was extra-cautious and
walked stuff I was certainly capable of riding, or at least would
normally have had a go at. Since there were lots of technical rocky
bits on this path, I ended up walking a fair bit of it. </p>

<img align="left" width=375 height=199 src="betws2-sm.jpg">

<p> But maybe doing so much walking was a good thing, as the scenery
was breathtakingly beautiful, with all the jagged hills around. I
thought that if I ever did a GoFar route around here I would
definitely put this track on it. </p>

<p> Finally I was back to the good old A5, so I zipped east on it back
to Betwys-Y-Coed. And as I pulled up to the B&B at 20 to 7, I found
Simon just parking his car! As it turns out, he had been concerned
that I might be annoyed by him being late, as much as I had been
concerned that he might be worrying about me because I was late. </p>

<a name="day21"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 21 (Saturday 29-July)</h2></font>

<p> Today was a lazy day for Simon and me. First we took a short walk
round town (Betws-Y-Coed), then we took the car to Conwy to see the
castle. They have some good information boards there so you get some
idea of how the castle was used through the ages (it was built in the
early 13th century). </p>

<p> Then after lunch and a bit of wander around Conwy we went to Great
Orme, a small peninsula sticking out of Wales. We had a walk along the
sand flats. I found some small anemones and crabs in a tidal, and I
demonstrated to Simon how barnacles can be easily removed from rocks
if you're quick enough (they aren't clinging so tightly to rocks all
the time, they only cling tightly when they sense they're in danger). </p>

<p> Then, I'm almost ashamed to admit it, we drove to the top of the
hill of the peninsula. The day had turned sunny and bright (it had
rained earlier) and the view was great. But it felt very
anticlimactic. Great, nice view, what do we do now? It would have been
far better if we had walked to the top from the beach. It really
wasn't very far and it would have made the view seem deserved. </p>

<p> Anyway, after lounging about in the sun on top of the hill, we
headed back down and back to our B&B. </p>

<hr>

<a name="day22"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 22 (Sunday 30-July)</h2></font>

<p> Simon and I had a nice walk today. We started right from our B&B,
so we didn't use the car today. Maybe this helps to compensate for
excessive car use yesterday. </p>

<img width=350 height=230 align=right src="byc-lake-sm.jpg">

<p> First we did a loop through Gwydir Forest to get to Llyn Elsi (a
pretty lake with lots of birds), then went along an old Roman Road
(Sarn Helen) to get to Afon Llugwy, the stream that runs by
Betws-Y-Coed. We followed this away from town, then crossed over and
came back. We saw the Ugly House (a house made of large,
irregularly-shaped stones), Swallow Falls, and the Miners' Bridge (a
narrow wooden bridge that makes quite a steep slope as it crosses the
river). </p>

<p> The day was warm & sunny, and we enjoyed ourselves quite a bit,
stopping frequently to admire the view and take pictures. </p>

<p> Finally we were back in town and were surprised to find the
outdoors shops (of which there are many in Betws-y-Coed) open at 5pm
on a Sunday. We bought a small tabletop tripod (or in or case it'll be
more likely used as a rocktop tripod), then headed back to our B&B for
a shower. </p>

<p> Total distance for today: about 8.5 miles on foot. </p>

<p> Tomorrow Simon and I will drive to Scotland for a wedding. </p>

<hr>

<a name="day25"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 25 (Wednesday 2-August)</h2></font>

<p> The wedding was yesterday, so today we drove from Scotland to the
North York Moors, where I will spend a couple of days riding with John
Murphy and other MTBers. We had a detailed map of how to get to his
place, courtesy of <a
href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/">Streetmap</a>, which at first
caused us quite a bit of confusion, because it was so detailed that we
couldn't figure out exactly where in the NY Moors it was. Eventually
we figured it out, but when we got there, the map seemed to suggest
that we go down this tiny rough dirt track with grass growing in the
middle. Simon objected: if this was the wrong way, it looked like it
would be vey difficult to turn around and come back. I asked a kid at
the nearby farm where the Murphys lived, and he pointed me down the
little track. So we went, and soon came to a farm house with lots of
chickens in the yard. John came out of the house, and we knew we'd
found the right place. Also immediately after, Arthur came rolling in,
having ridden from the Malton train station, about 40 miles away.  </p>

<p> Simon helped me unpack my stuff, and after a cup of tea, he headed
on his way back to Cambridge. Pam, John's wife, made us some very
tasty veggie pasties for dinner. Later than evening, Andrew and Karen
arrived, and we were all set for the next day's riding. </p>

<p> John scared us
all by saying that his planned route was 40 miles long. Now I can
certainly do 40 miles, even 40 miles in hills, but 40 miles of
difficult off-road in hills? Um... I've done 30 miles in Calderdale
(the <a href="../halfmonty.html">Half Monty</a>) and 30 miles in Wales
(the <a href="#day11">MBR route through Doethie Valley</a>), so I know
I can do 30 hard miles, but 40? John assured us that it wouldn't be
that hard: basically there was only one hard climb, and he wasn't
planning on going very fast. I begin to think I might survive... </p>

<hr>

<a name="day26"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 26 (Thursday 3-August)</h2></font>

<p> The ride was really nice. The weather forecast threatened rain,
but it held off during the day, leaving us with a mixture of sun and
clouds for the day's riding. The day began with the requisite bike
fettling: Andrew had just bought a Canondale Raven and was still
getting it set up to his tastes. Karen had just gotten new disk brakes
on her Giant, which were squeaking, requiring the occasional stop for
a fiddle. John, Arthur, and I didn't have new bikes or new parts on
our bikes, so we just threw some oil on our chains before heading off.
</p>

<img align="right" width=228 height=350 src="NYMoors-sm.jpg">

<p> The ride proper started off with a two mile on-road jaunt to get to
the start of the tracks, then did a big loop to the east of John's
place, with lunch at the Lion Inn on Blakey Ridge. After a decent
lunch, we headed off along an old railway line, then some more
bridleways, then finally on the road back to John's place. </p>

<p> The tracks varied. The best were rocky and required you to
maneuver between them to get anywhere. There were also some nice
narrow tracks which required concentration to keep to bike from
wandering into the heather. And then there was the railway line. It
was wide and boring, and we went along it pretty fast to get it over
with. </p>

<p> The North York Moors have a very open feel to them. The vegetation
is almost exclusively heather, with a bit of gorse here and
there. It's not nearly as hilly as Calderdale or the bits of Wales I
was riding around. Basically, it seems that there's a plateau, and at
the edges of the plateau there are incredibly steep hills (1 in 3
occurs frequently on the roads), and you also get very steep slopes in
valleys carved out of the plateau, but if you can manage to avoid the
valleys, once you're up on the plateau it's pretty level. And John's
route was cleverly designed to avoid the bad hills. Even the climb up
to Blakey Ridge was done at a shallow angle, so we were able to go up
the entire way in the middle ring. </p>

<p> After the ride, Andrew and Karen packed up their bikes and headed
out, and John, Arthur and I took showers. Soon after that the wather
turned all showery, with the rain that been promised heaving from the
sky. Those of us who remained went to a nearby pub for dinner. I had
some Theakston's Black Bull which was very good. </p>

<p> Total distance for today: about 42 miles. </p>

<hr>

<a name="day27"></a>
<font color="#0000ff"><h2>Day 27 (Friday 4-August)</h2></font>

<p> This morning after breakfast, Arthur headed out to ried to Malton,
where he would take the train back to York. I wished I could join him,
but I had packed assuming I'd only be riding a mile or two to the
station in Danby rather than 40 miles to Malton. Next time I will have
to pack much more lightly so I can do that. </p>

<p> After waving goodbye to Arthur, and waiting until we had drunk
some more tea, John and I headed out for a short, slowish ride around
a random collection of bridleways. The last one, just above his house,
was the best. It was riddled with rocks of all sizes, just sparse
enough that if you're nimble enough you could steer around most of
them, getting the smooth dirt between. I enjoyed the challenge of this
bit. But all too soon it was over, and we were doing the final descent
to Joh's place. We had a lunch of pizza. </p>

<p> That evening Pam and John took me to Malton to get a train for
Cambridge. I'd originally planned on taking the train from nearby
Danby, but the trains there are infrequent and connections ad bad, so
it would have added quite a few hours to my journey. The train from
Malton to York was very crowded, so I stood in the doorway with my
bike. The train from York to Peterborough was not crowded at all. They
had a special locked compartment for the bike to go into, which was
fine until I got to Peterborough and then had to quickly find a
conductor to get my bike out before the train headed off. The train
from Peterborough to Cambridge was delayed by 45 mins, but when it
came there was plenty of room. I put the bike in the doorway and got a
seat next to it, moving it whenever the train stopped. Finally, after
a short ride, I was home again. </p>

<p> Total distance for today: about 15 miles on the bike, 40 miles in
a car, and a bit over 200 on the train. </p>
