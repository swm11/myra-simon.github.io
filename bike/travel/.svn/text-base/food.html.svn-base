<p> Ever since I was a kid I wanted to do bike touring. I liked the
idea of packing everything on my bike and heading out. So at the age
of 16 when I finally saved up enough money to buy myself a nice bike,
I bought a bike designed for touring. Or so I thought; it was called Le
Tour. Yes, I know! At least now I do, and I laugh at my ignorance
then. </p>

<p> Anyway, two years later, in '85, I packed up my "touring bike" and
went for a tour around New York State. I started in Rochester, where I
was working for the summer and headed east towards the <a
href="http://www.adirondacks.org/">Adirondack Mountain</a>s. I was very
ignorant of just what equipment I would need, and how to carry it.
