<p> Ever since I was a kid I wanted to do bike touring. I liked the
idea of packing everything on my bike and heading out. So at the age
of 16 when I finally saved up enough money to buy myself a nice bike,
I bought a bike designed for touring. Or so I thought; it was called
Le Tour. Yes, I know! At least now I do. I laugh at my ignorance
then. </p>

<p> Anyway, two years later, in '85, I packed up my "touring bike" and
went for a tour around <a href="newyork/">New York State</a>. I
started in Rochester, where I was working for the summer and headed
east towards the <a href="http://www.adirondacks.org/">Adirondack
Mountains</a>. I was very ignorant about just about everything related
to bike touring.  The stupidest thing I did is that I didn't bring a
sleeping bag with me! I assumed that since I'd be bike touring in the
summer, it would be plenty warm at night, and so I would be able to
sleep with just a sweatshirt on. Well, I didn't sleep very well the
first night, and I didn't get much sleep at all until I bought some
extra layers of clothes. Even then the only nights I really slept well
were when someone loaned me a blanket or sleeping bag. </p>

<p> Another major mistake was that at taht time I had the habit of
skipping lunch, and I thought I could continue that while I was
touring. Big mistake; I had vastly underestimated my caloric
requirements. One day I found myself overwhelmingly sleepy in the
middle of the day, caused no doubt by a combination of not sleeping
enough and not eating enough. So I lay down in some long grass by the
side of the road for a nap. A friendly couple who had met me earlier
recognized my bike and rescued me with some food, and I made sure I
ate lunch after that. </p>

<p> My final big mistake was not using front panniers. All my stuff
was placed in a pair of rear panniers, a rack-top bag, and a handlebar
bag. The result was that my load was placed very high on my bike
making it quite unstable. </p>

<p> I also found that the ladies' frame bike that I had wasn't the
best design for me. I could only carry one water bottle on the frame
(and so carried a liter bottle of water in my panniers), and the pump
was in a very awkward place and kept getting knocked off. </p>

<p> By my next tour, in 1990, I had my act together much better. I had
the full set of panniers (two front, two rear) and I carefully
selected my gear so that everything fit into them. The only thing I
had on the top of my rack was my mascot, a dinosuar (a plastic
cetiosaurus from the British Museum of Natural History). The bike this
time really was intended for touring: a Panasonic PT3500 with
cantilever brakes, triple chainring, long chainstays, and two
waterbottle mounts. It worked well for me then, hauling me up all the
steep hills in <a href="../oregon.html">Oregon</a>. This time I
brought a sleeping bag with me (a nice down one)
