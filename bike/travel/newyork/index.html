<p> I come from New York State. Often when I tell people this they ask
"Oh, how do you like living in such a big city?"  I answer "I don't
know; the biggest city I've lived in is Philadelphia."  While a very
large proportion of the population of New York State live in or near
New York City, the vast majority of the area of the state is rural. In
fact about 1/6 of the area of the state is occupied by Adirondack
Park, the largest state park in the US. This is a mostly wild area
full of hills, dense forests, clear streams, and lots of wildlife
including coyotes and bears. </p>

<p> My first bicycle tour was in 1985. I was working over the summer
in Rochester NY, where I was going to university, and decided that the
kind of vacation I wanted was to hop on my bike and go somewhere. I
decided I wanted to see Adirondack Park since I'd never been there. So
I bought some panniers (rear ones only; this was a mistake, as the
bike was very top-heavy) and headed out. I didn't bring along anything
to write in, but I found myself wanting to write about my travels, so
I wrote my diary in the spare pages of my addess book.  I've added
comments in square brackets []. One of the things I find strange about
this diary is that when I mention taking showers it's usually in the
morning. This is my usual time of taking a shower, but when I'm doing
lots of exercise during the day it's much more sensible to shower in
the evening and go to bed clean. I'm surprised that I hadn't
discovered this obvious fact during this first bike tour.  </p>

<p> Started from Goler [apartment building in Rochester I was living
in over the summer] about 8:30am, took Seaway Trail to Fairhaven State
Park, arrived about 4:30pm. Set up camp next to Lake Ontario, went to
get food and take pictures. Came back, ate dinner, spilled semi-hot
tea on my left thigh, got a slight burn. Ranger came by and said I was
in the wrong place, helped me move to the "right place": campsite Y on
the tent overflow area. At about 10pm the people in X next door came
back and I discovered my tent was practically in thier campsite. They
went to complain to the ranger; when they discovered that I'd been
moved once already they let me stay. </p>

<p> I did not have enough clothes with me for the night and I was too
cold to sleep. [I didn't have a sleeping bag with me! I thought, this
is summer, so I won't need one. Not very wise...] I shivered all night
and around 2am went down to the lake to look at the stars, which we
very beautiful. Saw a shooting star. Good luck? </p>

<p> Started from Fairhaven about 8:30 after an essentially sleepless
night. Took Seaway Trail again. Lots of hills until I hit route 104B,
then pretty flat. Stopped at corner of route 3 and 104B to get water
at a house. Really friendly people -- Bobby and Lynda. Continuing on,
I had planned to take a rest at Southwick Beach, but I could not make
it. About a couple miles after Selkirk I pulled over, parked my bike,
and fell asleep under a tree. [I'm pretty sure that this extreme
tiredness was caused as much by lack of food as lack of sleep. Back
then I had the habit of skipping lunch, and I tried to keep up this
habit while I was bike touring!] Bobby and Lynda came by on their
motorcycle, asked if I was all right. I said yes. They offered to buy
me lunch at McDonalds, I agreed. So they brought back some food [I had
a fish sandwich, I remember it still!], we had a picic, and then I was
on my way. I have discovered the value of a good lunch. </p>

<p> Got to Watertown about 6pm, Glenn [Foster, a friend from
university] was very surprised to see me [as I'd turned up completely
unannounced...]. I slept very soundly in thier spare bedroom. </p>

<img align=right width=350 height=255 src="bear-sm.jpg">

<p> Got up at 9am, took shower, ate breakfast (pancakes) cooked by
Glenn. [And I noted that the Fosters were planning on taking Glenn
back to Rochester on the 28th.] Went to Sears to get sweatpants and
thermal undershirt; only got sweatpants because thermal stuff wasn't
in yet. Ate lunch in Harrissville, talked with lady who wishes she
could just take off and go touring. Got into Cranberry Lake State Park
about 7pm, went to see bears at town dump, then set up tent and ate
dinner. </p>

<p> Again too cold to sleep, about 2am went down to lake to listen to
water (too cloudy for stars). </p>

<p> Got up at 6am, hiked Bear Mountain (beautiful view!). Took
pictures at lake, took shower. </p>

<p> Ate lunch at Tupper Lake, bought thermal shirt at dinky clothing
store, got to Meadowbrook about 5:30. </p>

<p> Biked to Adirondack Lodge, climbed Mount Marcy [highest mountain
in New York State], met Doug and John [nephew and uncle who were going
up the mountain at about the same pace I was] came back down with
them. Got ride with them to route 73, stopped on way back at Lake
Placid to buy dinner, went right by the campsite the first time [it
was dark by then], got almost to Saranac Lake before I realized,
turned around, found it, ate and slept. </p>

<p> Started out about 8:30, went to Lake Placid, did laundry, bought
new rear tire, film, souvenier T-shirt. Ate lunch in Elizabethtown,
met two other cyclists (Linda and Bonnie). We rode to Essex to cross
Lake Champlain by ferry into Vermont, and we shared a campsite at
Mount Philo State Park. They let me use their spare sleeping bag
(luxury!). Another lady (Nancy from Toronto) joined us later. Slept
well! Changed tire before shower. </p>

<p> Left Mt Philo 9 or 10am after saying goodbye to Bonnie, Linda,
and Nancy. Nancy invited me to stop by if I ever get to Toronto, and I
will. I like her. [Actually I never did look her up, although I went
to Toronto a couple of times.]  </p>

<p> Biked to Burlington, took ferry to NY State, then to Ausable Chasm
which was not worth the $9 I paid for it. [I'd been spoiled by the
very beautiful (and much cheaper) gorges near Ithaca.] Then on to
Plattsburgh, or specifically to Cumberland Bay State Park. Saw
Hitchcock movie <i>The 39 Steps</i> at campground but did not really
understand it. </p>

<p> Left Cumberland about 8:30, caught 9:00 ferry to Grand Isle, went
through Vermont islands, crossed Canadian boundary into Quebec. Had
the absurd notion that I could be at the campsites at the upper end of
Lake St Lawrence (near Cronwall, Ontario) by nightfall, then go
canoeing the next day. This is about 130 miles. Of course I did not
make it. Lunch found me in Hemmingford, Quebec, by 5pm I was in
Huntington (still in Quebec). I could not go the remaining 50 miles
before dark (not to mention that before I got to Hemmingford it had
started to rain) so I camped in a roadside park [which was <i>not</i>
an official campground] by Route 138 just out of Huntington. </p>

<h4>Sun, Aug 25</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Well, the Quebec Provincial Police didn't kick me out of the park
so I got a sound night's sleep. The small shelter I had set my tent up
under kept everything pretty well dry, but there were still lots of
water droplets on it so I had to pack it up wet. Biking along Route
138 as I went back into NY State I discovered that biking in the rain
is not bad; you just accept that you will get wet and then enjoy
it. </p>

<p> I got a flat and misaligned wheel from expension grates on bridge
to Canada (Ontario this time) at Cornwall. Tried to fix it on island;
patch held only to entrance of Park Long Sault. Rain finally stopped
at about 6pm. Young bearded ranger (packsacker [as he called himself])
came over to admire my stove. This campground is almost deserted so
late in the year. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Mon, Aug 26</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> One of the park rangers took me to a hardware store in Ingleside;
they didn't have tube to fit my tire size. He then took me to K-mart
in Cornwall, where I bought 2 tubes, a new tube repair kit, and a new
rear reflector to replace the one that had broken off. I put the new
tube in and was on the way by about noon. </p>

<p> I ate lunch in Morrissburg (croissants and fruit salad) and
crossed into NY State at Ogdensburg. The bridge was corrugated and I
was afraid I would whipe out. Luckily I did not. I got my chain sorted
out ($.50) in Ogdensburg; the rain had made it squeak like crazy [and
I hadn't brought along any chain oil!]. Just out of Ogdensburg I
noticed my tire was soft. I pumped it up, and then after about 4 miles
it was flat again. After 2 or 3 more pumpings I made it to Jaques
Cartier State Park. I ate dinner and then 2 ladies from the next
campsite invited me to share thier fire. I accepted and talked with
them for awhile, then I went to bed. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Tues, Aug 27</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Got up as usual, returned the blanket the ladies next door had let
me borrow (wool army blanket -- boy it felt good!), took a shower,
changed my tube (again!) found that holes in new tube looked like
holes in last tube. I am suspicious. Is my tire doing it? </p>

<p> I bike against a headwind to Alexandria Bay, eat a huge lunch. I
realize that I am eating more in an effort to procrastinate riding
again. I am getting mentally and physically very tired. I take route
26 to 37 to Watertown. Those 20 miles from Alex Bay to W-town took (it
seems!) forever; the headwind was so strong. My ankle (which has been
hurting off and on since last Mon when I pulled in to Cranberry Lake)
hurts and I have a new ache in my right knee. I decided on the way
that I will leave Watertown tomorrow not by bike but by bus -- I do
not want to spend 3 more days biking under clouds against a headwind.
[I mentioned a bus in my diary but I'd conveniently arranged to arrive
in Watertown the evening before the Fosters were taking Glenn back to
university.] When I got to Fosters I found that they had room to take
me (and bike!) back to Rochester. [In fact Glenn's Dad said he
suspected that I would come back to W-town in time to hitch a ride
with them.] I take a shower, fill out last few post cards (1000
Islands) and sleep. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Postscript</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> At the end of my diary I wrote a list of things that I thought
would be useful to bring along for my next biking trip. The main thing
I thought would be useful was a sleeping bag, although I thought hot
cocoa would be useful too (being hot and having lots of calories --
calories are good when you're bike touring). </p>
