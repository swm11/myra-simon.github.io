<h2>What sort of bike should you get?</h2>

<blockquote>

If you are a beginning off-road rider, you should be looking at a bike
with front suspension only (called a hardtail), or even a rigid bike
(with no susension fork). A good quality full suspension bike is too
expensive to be a beginner bike. If you want the bike mainly for
riding on paved surfaces a rigid bike is a better bet. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4> The frame</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The frame is the heart of a mountain bike, and you want to make
sure you get a good one. If the bike comes with mediocre parts on it
you can replace them, but once you replace the frame it's a different
bike. </p>

<p> When looking for a not-too-expensive mountain bike, remember that
boring is good. If the bike is too fancy and radical looking,
especially if it's inexpensive, it's probably not a good bike. Unless
you're going for a full-suspension bike, the traditional diamond frame
is the best (as in the Rockhopper below). Any frame design other than
this will be more heavy or weaker. The only exceptions in this price
range are bikes made by Haro or GT, and these bikes only have small
variations on the diamond frame. </p>

<p> If you're not sure exactly what a diamond frame is, let's look at
a bike that doesn't have one, the Specialized Enduro below. This bike has
rear suspension (the cylindrical bit where the seatstays meet the frame is
the rear shock) thus it requires a different geometry to accommodate
the shock and the movement of the back part of the bike. You will
often see somewhat odd-looking frame designs in full-suspension bikes,
but they are rarely useful in hardtails or rigid bikes. (Don't drool
too much over this bike. It is unfortunately well out of the price
range of this article.) </p>

<p> Many mountain bikes today have a sloping top tube (clearly seen in
the Rockhopper). This is a good thing, as it gives you more crotch
clearance for the same size of bike. Crotch clearance is the distance
between the top tube and your crotch when you are standing over the
bike in your bike shoes. It is important because you often crash when
riding off-road, and it's good to have a bike that stays out of your
way when you come off unexpectedly.  </p>

<h4>To bounce or not to bounce</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> Since real rear suspension (as of the Specialized Enduro above) is
out of the price range of this article, we'll only consider two kinds
of suspension: a suspension fork, and a suspension seat post. First
I'll discuss the fork. <p> 

<p> Should you get bike with a suspension fork?  I think the answer is
pretty short and simple: if your main use of the bike is for riding on
rough off-road, then get a suspension fork, unless your budget is
really low. A good suspension fork is a real boon to off-road riding.
Not only does it make the ride more comfortable, but it can greatly
improve your control over the bike. For example, if you're coming down
a hill and there's a small branch diagonally across the path, the
suspension fork can help you get over it safely, while with a rigid
fork, your front wheel has more of a tendency to by shunted aside by
the branch, leaving you in a heap on the trail. Since most mountain
bikes come with suspension forks, this is the easy option. <p> 

<p> However, if you have very little money (say you want to spend less
than 300 quid, including everything you'll need, like lock and
lights), a rigid bike is best, even for riding off-road. For example,
a Specialized HardRock Rigid is better suited to off-road riding than
most bikes for that price, even ones with a suspension fork. The
reason is that most suspension forks on bikes that cheap are really
not very good, and while they add a bit of comfort for your off-road
riding, they lack the rigidity and damping that allows you to maintain
the best control over your bike through the rough stuff. In addition,
the frame and other components will be of lower quality to allow for
the cost of the suspension fork, and they may not be up to real
off-roading. If your budget really is that low, getting a HardRock
Rigid would get you riding off-road on a good bike straight off, and
then when you've saved up more money you can add a nice suspension
fork. </p>

<p> However, many people buy mountain bikes for general purpose
riding, not for hard-core off-road riding. MTBs are durable, adaptable
machines that can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including
riding to work, touring, and just getting out into the countryside for
a pleasant spin on a sunny day. If your main use of the bike is not
off-road riding, you would be better off getting a rigid (not
suspension) fork. Even if your planned use of the bike includes a bit
of off-road riding, such as riding on fairly smooth unpaved surfaced
(cinder-surfaced bike trails, forest roads), a rigid bike would be
best. This is because suspension forks are more expensive, heavier,
more likely to go wrong, and more attractive to thieves than rigid
forks. In addition, if you stand up to pedal you can lose a fair bit
of your energy in bobbing the fork up and down. On rough trails, the
suspension fork is so effective at smoothing out the trail bumps that
it offsets all these drawbacks, but roads are smooth enough that the
fatter tires you get on a MTB provides enough cusioning for all-day
comfort in the saddle. This is true even if you get fairly thin
(1.5"), smooth, street-specific tires. </p>

<p> Decent-quality rigid MTBs can be hard to find. Many people seem to
feel that suspension must be better than no suspension, even for road
riding, and so avoid MTBs with rigid forks. However, good bikes are
out there (some manufacturers call them "Urban bikes"), and I urge you
to make the effort to find them. At time of writing, Marin make the
Muirwoods, Specialized do the HardRock Rigid, and Ridgeback do a
series of bikes called "Switch". These are super choices for general
purpose riding. </p>

<p> A suspension seatpost is another form of suspension that sometimes
crops up on some bikes of this price range. They usually come on bikes
meant for town use, or on "comfort bikes" meant for slow riding on
flat roads, rather than on bikes aimed at real off-road riding.  I
feel that a suspension seatport is of use either on or off-road. If
you hit a pothole on the road, the main place you feel it is in your
backside, and a suspension seatpost can help smooth it out. Off-road,
it can help smooth out minor trail bumps, allowing you to stay in the
saddle for more situations, which can reduce fatigue. It will be of
little help on big bumps, which is why proper rear suspension is
useful on a bike used for rough off-road.  There are some drawbacks to
suspension seatposts, and they are the same as for suspension forks:
suspension seatposts are more expensive, heavier, and more likely to
go wrong that ordinary ones. However, they are much simpler than
suspension forks, and they have much less travel, so the difference in
price and reliability isn't so great as with suspension forks. </p>

<h4>Do you need disk brakes?</h4>

<blockquote>

<center><table border=0 align="center">
<tr><td align="center">

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">
<i>Kona Caldera with disk brakes</i></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p> Disk brakes are popping up on more and more bikes nowdays, and a
few bikes in the price range considered by this article have
them. Generally, they are included only on bikes meant for real
off-road riding. The main advantages of disk brakes are that they work
much better in the wet (especially off-road, since mud can interfere
with your braking even more than plain water) and that your rims don't
wear down as a result of brake pads rubbing them, so they last alot
longer. The rim wear issue ends up being the deciding factor for some
people: if you ride in areas with gritty soil, you can wear through
rims quite quickly.  The disadvantages are that they weigh and cost
alot more than rim brakes, add appeal for thieves, and make getting
your wheels off the bike a bit more difficult. If you're planning to
use your bike mainly for road riding, don't even consider them. They
are of most use off-road if you often ride when it's wet, so you'll
take full advantage of the reduced rim wear and better wet-weather
performance.  I would suggest that a beginner would probably be better
off without them, because not having them will mean that your bike can
have a better frame and components for the same amount of money. You
won't really know if you need them until you've been riding awhile and
know what sorts of situations you'll be riding in. However, it can pay
to buy a bike that's disk-brake ready: it should have disk mounts on
the frame, and preferably disk-ready hubs. Then if you want to upgrade
to disk brakes it's a fairly painless process, and not all that
expensive, as you'll only pay for the disk brakes themselves. </p>
