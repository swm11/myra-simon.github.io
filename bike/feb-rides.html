<h1> February Road Rides </h1>

<h4>Background</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I've had a full-time job for a few years now. When I was a grad
student at U Penn, I would ride 25-35 miles almost every Tuesday and
Thursday morning, and then ride 40 miles or more at least once on the
weekend. Thus I got in alot of miles and was pretty fit. </P>

<p> Just about as soon as I got here to Cambridge I was struck pretty
badly by RSI, the result of many years of bad typing practice. I did
very little cycling for about a year after that (summer '96 to summer
'97) but then tried to get back into it. But since I now have a full
time job I didn't feel justified in taking off the morning to go for a
bike ride. So gradually I settled into a routine where I try to go for
a bike ride (typically 20 miles long) one evening during the week, and
once during the weekend (30 miles or more).  I aim to ride at least 75
miles a week, including commuting miles (I ride 2.5 miles to and from
work each day). </P>

<p> Since I'm putting in alot fewer miles than I used to, I'm not as
fit as I used to be. I notice this mainly when I'm mountain biking,
when I can't keep up with the serious riders. I think this year I'd
like to get fitter, closer to what I used to be when I was at Penn,
which means spending more time on the bike. </p>

<h4>Reliability Rides</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> For the past couple of weekends the Cambridge Cycle Club were
holding their reliability rides. This is where a group of cyclists
aims to finish a ride in a given amount of time, and the goal is to
predict this time reasonably precisely. On the 13th of February was
the 50 mile ride. There were to be 3 groups, one finishing in less
than 2:30, one in 3 hours, and one in 3:30. For the third group, this
is an average of just over 14mph, which I knew I could do riding with
a group. So I went on the ride. </P>

</blockquote>

<h4>The 50 Miler</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I arrived at the meeting point and found lots of people I knew,
some of whom were riding with the faster groups. The fastest group
rolled out, then the middle group, then it was our turn. We had some
faster guys in with us because they'd arrived too late to go with the
middle group. We started out at a relaxed pace, and I thought: I can do
this. I felt confident and stayed near the front. We turned into a
pretty strong headwind. We were riding in a group, two abreast, and I
was in the second row. The guys in front were putting in a good pace,
and I had to work to keep up, even drafting. Then the leader of the
ride noted that some people had fallen off the back, so I wasn't the
only one suffering. The guys in front eased off to regroup, and I had
a bit of a chance to recover. Soon we got going again, at a slightly
slower pace. </P>

<p> Then the guy in front of me pulled off. I didn't want to be in
front. Not at all. But I was in the position to move up, so I did. I
stayed at the front for a couple of miles, trying to keep a steady
pace. Finally, when I'd just about knocked myself out, I pulled off,
getting back into the second row. I'd just begun to recover when we
went up a hill. It was a big hill by Cambridge standards. At first I
struggled to keep up with the guys in front, but then I gave up. No
way was I going to make it. I kept to the left and let my speed fall,
allowing anyone who wanted to pass me. Actually not many did; I wasn't
the only one to have fallen off on the hill, and I wasn't the last to
the top. However when I reached the top I was panting madly. Luckily
the guys in front had stopped to regroup at the top. I stopped, draped
myself over my handlebars and tried to catch my breath. When we were
all at the top and more or less recovered we headed off again. </P>

<p> After that I was fine. I tried to stay a bit further back in the
pack and didn't take any more pulls at the front, and I kept up on all
the hills. The weather was gorgeous, bright sunshine and cool
temperatures. I felt really good when I got back. We'd finished the 50
miles just a few minutes short of 3h 30mins, so I felt pleased. I felt
very tired for the rest of the day, and my legs ached for a couple of
days, but I had handled the ride well. I determined to do the next
reliability ride, the 75 miler. </P>

<h4>A Midweek Ride</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> To make sure I was up for it, I went for a longer midweek ride
than usual. It was dark (of course, I was starting at about 7:30pm and
it's February) and drizzling when I set out. I debated not doing the
ride, but it wasn't raining too hard so I'd be all right if it didn't
get any wetter. I headed out of town along a muddy farm road to avoid
the big A-road. I went over the BIG HILL (in Cambridge terms, it's
Chapel Hill between Haslingfield and Barrington) and as I got to the
bottom on the other side I saw a car with dim lights coming towards
me. Suddenly the headlights changed distance and rearranged
themselves. It was a few fellow cyclists out for a night ride! We all
said hello to each other and rode on. This cheered me up, as I rarely
see other cyclists when I'm out doing my night-time road rides. </p>

<p> I headed towards Orwell. The road between Barrington and Orwell is
usually pretty empty, and I like this. Tonight the road had lots of
running water along it. I was glad both for my full mudguards and for
the fact that I'd decided to go for a road ride instead of a MTB ride
(which I often do, joining the local CTC mountain bike section for
their Tuesday-Thursday evening rides). The ground must be a soupy
mess... I went through Orwell and past Wimpole Hall, a National Trust
property. A couple of years ago I took a tour of Wimpole Hall and got
a sore neck from looking up all the time. It has really amazing
ceilings! The grounds feature a pretty pond, some unusual varieties of
sheep, and a folly (fake ruins) making it a good place to visit when
the weather's nice. This evening, however, the weather was not nice at
all: the rain had picked up, but still not enough to soak me. I
pedalled on, going up the hill beyond Wimpole Hall. </p>

<p> After leaving the Wimpole Hall Road (I'm sure it has a name but
I've never noticed it) I rode along a smallish A-road for a few miles
to Longstowe, then along a B-road, then along another A-road back to
Cambridge. I don't like going out of town on the B-road, since it's
long and pretty boring, but coming back along it is better since the
wind is usually behind me and I can get it over with more quickly.
The A-roads are better at night than during the day since there are
fewer people driving along them. I don't feel at risk during the day
with more traffic, but it's just nicer when I don't have cars whizzing
by every other second. As I rode along the A-roads I mentally assessed
my visibility: two bright LED lights set on steady beam, lots of
Scotchlite reflective stuff (a strip on my mudguard, a patch on my
under-seat bag, lots of wide reflective bits on my fluorescent yellow
jacket, big reflective patch on my helmet), a British Standard
reflector, and of course a nice bright headlight in front. If I were
hit from behind someone would have to be aiming for me... </P>

<p> Finally after traversing across town I was back home</p>

<h4>The 75 Miler</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The day of the 75 mile reliability dawned cold, frosty, and
sunny. All the puddles of the previous night's rain were frozen. I
dressed a bit warmer than I had for the last ride and headed to the
meeting place. I recognized fewer people this time, and fewer people
started out on the ride. By the 10 mile mark we'd lost two people, one
who wasn't able to keep up and didn't want to hold us up, and one who
got a puncture. We rode on. The goal this time was to complete the
ride in 5:45, including a short tea stop at the 50 mile
mark. Gradually the puddles melted and the air warmed up. On the way
into Saffron Walden three people drifted off, one person who lived
near there and had cycled into Cambridge that morning, and two who
weren't feeling up to doing the whole ride. In Saffron Walden we lost
two more who decided to stop at a cafe there, but on the way out we
picked up a guy who had started with the medium speed group and not
been able to keep up. Finally we were at the our tea stop at a
truckers cafe off the A10 which is a hangout for motorcyclists. It was
really amusing. All around the edges of the cafe were tables of fat
bikers in black leather, and in the middle were skinny bikers in
bright lycra. Well, OK, so it wasn't that extreme (I'm by no means
skinny!) but there was a big contrast between the groups. </p>

<p> I crammed down a cheese and tomato roll and a scone, refilled my
bottles, used the loo, and we were soon on our way. The 25 miles back
to Cambridge seemed easy. I was going strong and feeling good. I was
thinking my own thoughts, just pedalling along relaxedly. We completed
the 75 miles in 5h 34mins. Oddly I felt better when I got home after
the 75 miler than the 50 miler. Although again my legs ached for a
couple of days. </p>

<h4>Another Midweek Ride</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> I felt really good having done the 75 mile reliability
ride. Having ridden to the metting place, then back I'd done about 83
miles that day. I couldn't think of another year in which I'd ridden
80 miles or more in one day as early as February. It's good to know
that despite having been cycling for so long, there were still a few
things I hadn't done. </p>

<p> However all the aches I'd been getting in my legs told me that I'd
been pushing myself, and thus getting stronger. I didn't want to let
all that go to waste, so I went for another longish midweek ride last
night. </p>

<p> Actually I wasn't in the mood for a ride last night, but Simon (my
boyfriend) was at a college dinner so I was on my own for the
evening. Looking at a map helped boost my enthusiasm for the ride: it
helps to know I'll be riding on roads I liked. I plotted out a route
with some hills, microwaved some dinner, changed into bike clothes,
and set out. It was cool verging on cold. I felt the breeze sharp
against my face, threatening to invade my jacket. The ride started
out the same way as last week's ride, along the dark deserted muddy
farm road. The night was clear, and Orion was in the sky above me as I
rode along, savoring the freshness of the air and the feeling of the
pedals rotating. </p>

<p> Normally I'm not afraid of the dark, but along the muddy farm
road, far from houses and cars, I got the feeling there was something
behind me. I couldn't hear or see anything, and I knew logically that
there was nothing behind me. But that didn't stop me from looking over
my shoulder. So I tried to convince myself there was nothing around. I
tried to think of what <i>could</i> be there. I could only come up with a
mountain lion that had been sighted in the area recently. Hum, that
was scary enough... Then I thought of <i>An American Werewolf in
London</i>. Shudder, now that was a fearsome beast! I tried to think
of something less frightening, like bike parts. That worked. Then I
was off the farm road, back onto sensible tarmac with houses nearby
and my fears left me. </p>

<p> I'd planned quite a long route, but I had a good place to turn
back if I didn't feel like doing the whole thing. I got to the
turn-off point and checked my distance (pulling the bike computer from
its mount and holding it in the beam of my headlight). I'd done just
under 15 miles, and I'd go about the same distance to get back. Yeah,
that was good enough. I turned to go home. </p>

<p> The modified route took me along the back of the Duxford Air
Museum airfield. I saw a dimly glowing orange/red thing through the
trees off the side of the road. I tried to figure out if it was a
reflective sign illuminated by my headlight or perhaps a fluorescent
orange wind sock. I kept looking at it but I didn't seem to be getting
closer to it. Then it disappeared behind a clump of trees. It suddenly
occurred to me: was it the moon, just above the horizon? I turned a
bend and there it was in front of me, the dim orange ball hanging on
the edge of the sky. I turned off my bright headlight and turned on my
(much dimmer) dynamo so I could see the moon better. I watched it as I
rode along the airfield, as it slowly disentangled itself from the
horizon. Then I was in Duxford. I headed north and back to
Cambridge. I kept an eye on the moon as it continued to rise,
gaining in brightness and losing its orangey hue. But the time I got home it
was well above the horizon and bright silvery white.  Looking at my
speedo back home I found I'd done just under 30 miles. Not bad for an
evening's ride. </p>

<p> This coming weekend is the 100 mile reliability ride. I don't
think I'll do it. I've been missing my mountain bike, what with
spending all this time on the road. </p>
