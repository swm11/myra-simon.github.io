I contacted the Forestry Commission in order to try and gain further info.
I intially contacted Info@northyorkmoors-npa.gov.uk (from their website) and
got a very nice reply from b.smith@northyorkmoors-npa.gov.uk (Bev Smith,
Information Service, North York Moors National Park) who suggested I contact
Brian Walker, Head Recreation Forester at North York Moors Forest District
Office. (E-MAIL TO n.york.moors.fdo@forestry.gov.uk)

What can I say, I emailed this Brian character at least a month ago, and as
yet have not received a reply.

The question I asked was "where is the Black route in Dalby Forest?"

Otherwise, the  Dalby Visitor Centre 01751 460295, which doesn't open until
about April or something may have info, but it's impossible to know yet.

Hope this helps - If you find out any more first, then please let me know
too.

Yeah it's pretty good.  Found the red and the green routes, but was
unable to find the black route.  Green is labelled as for family, and
red is labelled as "strenuous/challenging" taking 3.5 hours.  It was
strenuous, but it's only 15 miles, and it took us 1hr 54 min.  There
are only 2 "technical" descents, and one very steep climb, the rest is
"rolling" but very peaty in places so definitely gets classed as
energy sapping.

Four that I know of...

PORC (Penhurst Off Road Club) in Kent. Email Ian Moore (nick= Spag) at
ian@spagtime.freeserve.co.uk. He's technical director (ie. decides
where the routes are)

The LookOut just south of Bracknell which has an MTB hire place and
MTB trails. Most of the trails are mickey-mouse. You need a permit
(day or yearly). It backs on to most of the XC race courses used by
Gorrick MBC which in theory you aren't allowed to ride around. Gets
very busy in summer. No contact info but Bracknell Forest Tourist info
should have details.
http://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/council/bracknell_forest.htm

Aston Hill, Wendover. I talked to a guy at Checkendon SAMS race a year
or so back and he was setting up routes on FC land there. There was
talk of even getting a ski lift! I've got his phone number in my MTB
book of contacts which I can dig out.

Sherwood Pines (Nottingham). This has marked routes plus a very short
(less than a mile) technical singletrack. Dull, flat and mostly
fireroad. I've got a leaflet for it somewhere and half a ride report
written which may be in GoFar at some point. Rough route as well.

----------------------------

From: Giles Ayling <giles@tvp-uk.demon.co.uk>

I went over to the Look Out on Saturday, excellent place. The tracks
round the wood are wide, so you can get some good speed up if you want ,
while obviously looking out for others. The Bikers only area is also
good , it has section ranging from levelish paths thought the woods
right up to really steep/rough sections.

It also means that as you are only 1-1.5 miles from the car park, then
if you have come by car you do not have to load waterproofs etc. unless
you really want to.

I will certainly be going back again (You can also hire cycles if you
wanted), there is also the Coral Reef Leisure pool complex across the
road if you wanted to entertain all the family.

The only downside for some might be the fact that you are not actually
going anywhere

You are supposed to join the club over there to ride on the waymarked
courses though (it's an insurance thing) - they are on the web but I dont
have a URL I'm afraid.
From what I've heard the XC course is very good and the DH course is a bit

Myra,

Glad you enjoyed your visit. The tracks that arn't on the map are ones that
are no longer used on the curcuit or short cuts through to miss sections of
trail. You can ride on these trails but you have to be carful that they
don't bring you out on the Cross Country course or Downhills the wrong way.
We try and keep all the traffic heading in the same direction to avoid
accidents. Plus if the shortcuts and used trails become to heavily used
riders start to stray from the course and end up getting lost or missing
sections of the trail.

The map on the flyer will be fine the only trail missing from it is the new
downhill course which should be finished by April all being well.

Please get intouch if you have any more questions

Hi Myra

Directions from Dumfries, which is easily findable on most road atlas's.

1 -  Follow the A710 towards New Abbey for approx. 3 miles. Turn right onto  
forest drive signposted 'Mabie Forest'.

2 -  Park in pay and display carpark (£1 coin) using the highest couple of 
bays.

3 -  Follow signs for 'bike hire' to start of all trails at 'Riks Bike Shed'

Of course you can pop in to peruse the merchandise or blether about the trail 
condition if you like. Map board and trail information is available as are 
day passes for the 'jump park'.

Mabie is quite a small forest but there are plenty of singletrack trails to 
play on, the waymarked 'red route' is one of the best forestry cycle trails 
anywhere. Ask at the shop for info about detours etc.

Feel free to visit the shop anytime.

Hmmm... yes, but most of the best riding available is outside of such
centres. Still, leave the centres for those who can't look at a map and
go 'Oh, that looks good...'. Why not do a list of otger decent places to
ride as well (Dark Peak, Lake District, Quantocks, Calderdale etc)?

Forest of Dean stuff:

From Dan dangregory@palaver.junglelink.co.uk: The Pedalabikeaway Cycle
Centre at Cannop Ponds (on the B4226 between Cinderford and Coleford,
there are Brown tourist type roadsigns to help you) has parking and a
café and rentals and bike parts shop. Down from Speech House turn
right 300metres, or up from Lydbrook on the Wye.  Also good parking
with Toilets at Mallards Pike Lakes, or the Blakeney Straights
(Wenchford on the map.)

The tracks are waywarked and also all the Forest Enterprise Tracks are OK
apart from some single track bans to to weather conditions.
The OS maps are NOT accurate, the Cycling map you can get from The Heritage
Centre at Soudley and and the Cycle Centre are a bit better.

There are hundreds of miles of trails ranging from the Family Trails
to the Forest Roads (Hard track but rough) to single track gravel and
dirt. Lots of good climbing and descending.  The RFDCC usually meets
at the Cylce Centre on Sunday mornings.  
All the best, Dan

local riders are forever (and sometimes a bit irresponsibly) building
downhill courses up in the forest, and there are some established
trails and descents which also are good fun.
  
There is a MTB hire place, with a spares shop and cafe, but again I
can't remember where. It is in the forest towards Cinderford (I
think). THis is a good place to start from, at least to get a feel for
the place and some bike orientated maps.
  
I bought a map in a bike shop in Coleford or Christchurch only a quid or
so. I'll see if I can dig out some more info tonight.

I know i should pay more attention to local access issues, but the
forest is suffering from a few problems. The downhill courses were
dismantled by the FC a while back and there was talk/action about
limiting racing. Their are large aparts of the forest that are off
limits whilst i know of no enforcement i don't think it will do MTB
access the world of good running down a family on a barred trail....If
i remember right the singletrack is technically off limits, in
practice there is some nice riding particular in summer or when it is
frozen.

From: "Dan Gregory" <dangregory@palaver.junglelink.co.uk>

Directions to Pedalabikeaway Cycle Centre:

coming West from Cinderford you pass the Speech House
Hotel on the Left ( Southern Side of the B4226) descend the Speech House
Hill (famous in many Road Races) a short sharp descent, with a tight left
hand bend half-way down. At the bottom of the hill as the road levels out
you come to the intersection of B4226 and B4234, Turn Right (North) the
Pygmy Pinetum Nursery is on the Left, continue in direction of Lydbrook, and
Pedalabikeaway is on the Left after about 300metres opposite a row of
redbrick Forestry cottages.
There is a bike rental facility, Dave Evans has a retail shop there, and
there are also toilets and refreshments. Large car park which has introduced
a charge but as I rarely drive there I haven't noticed the fee. The Royal
Dean Forest  Cycling Club meet there every Sunday at 10.30 for their
off-road rides. The length and severity of the ride is decided by who is
there.
Aside from the many and varied trails there is the Sculpture Trail which
starts at Beechenhurst (at the bottom end of the Speech House Hill).
All the best,

Subject: RE: MTB centres

More suggestions for able map-readers, all in Devon:

Dartmoor - the park authority have some routes on leaflets, but most of
these go the wrong way, i.e. up the best downhills! Theoretically, riding
off bridleways, byways, UCRs, permissive cycle routes and most forestry
roads (quite how you find out which these are, I don't know) is a criminal
offence. I don't know of any cases where its been enforced, and I've never
see a ranger more than a few feet away from his Landy, usually in a car
park! The permissive routes are generally not mapped or signed either - part
of the deal with the landowners.
http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/

The "Reservoirs Hill" between the Teign and Bovey valleys - loads of legal
trails, great downhills included! Within the Dartmoor National Park, so the
same bylaw applies.

Woodbury and adjacent commons - many tracks are not mapped, but the
landowner allows public use for "quiet recreation" which includes
mountain-biking. Just don't scare the walkers and horses and try to stay
away from the soft bits. This comment goes for the other areas, too,
especially if you're not supposed to be there!

Haldon Hill - mostly Forestry Commission. Most of the best trails are
probably not really legal.

For the uninitiated - UCR is Unclassified Count Road. Metalled ones are
yellow on Landrangers, Unsurfaced ones are shown by green dots on Explorers.
Sometimes they get it wrong, though. The right of way is undefined on UCRs,
hence the OS's vagueness, but they are nearly always of at least Bridleway
status.

Very South East England:

Friston Forest - near Eastbourne, East Sussex. Close to eastern end of South
Downs Way.  Last time I heard - DH training and jumps, with Forest Ranger's
support, and a number of waymarked cycle routes, from wide, safe, boring
fire roads for all the family, to nice windy off-camber singletrack NOT for
all the family.

Penshurst - near Tunbridge Wells, Kent - Privately owned site  - has anyone
been there?  Is it as good as the magazine articles suggest?

Stanmer Park, Brighton, East Sussex.  Close to SDW,  site of Mint Sauce race
a few years ago.  No idea if it is legal to ride there or not, but many
people do and it is tolerated by the locals.  Strongly reminiscent of
woodland singletrack as featured in Mint Sauce cartoons, probably because Jo
Burt might well be spotted drinking tea and eating cake in the village tea
shop.  Not big enough to warrant a special visit though.

Houghton Forest - just north of Arundel, West Sussex. Similar to Stanmer,
only bigger.  Also next to SDW. Used to be the Sunday morning meeting place
of a large off-road club (whose name escapes me).

Queen Elizabeth Country Park, West Sussex - never been there, but reported
to be worth a visit.

I've just noticed that not all of the above fulfill Myra's criteria, but I'm
not going to delete it all now, having typed it in!

I've been once a couple of years ago.

Its quite fun - you can basically loop around various sections
and whenever things head downwards its often a neatly arranged 
downhill. More of a place to play really as its a fairly small 
area, with emphasis on downhilling, and since you pay for access
linking it into a longer ride is less appealing.

>Queen Elizabeth Country Park, West Sussex - never been there, but reported
>to be worth a visit.

http://www.bournemouth.co.uk/ptg/dd004323.htm

Also fun - there are 2 marked trails and the strenuous one is a lot
more entertaining than the family one. 

Pretty small, so if you were coming a long way then it would be worth 
working out a ride that linked in some of the South Downs way. There are 
a couple of routes in the vicinity (ie. one starts in the park and the
 other is adjacent) in a pack of maps that Hampshire county council sell 
and there were some in an issue of mtb world/pro.

The cafe at QE park also sells very fine cakes.

When I used to live in Hedge End near Southampton, we did a ride that
involved starting at Bishop's Waltham (south east of Winchester) and
riding east as far as QE Country Park. Two laps of the waymarked trails
then back up Butser Hill and home. 'Bout 50 miles which was a good day

Coming into Penshurst from the North with the grounds of P. Place on
your left.  At the t-junction in the middle of the village turn right
(or for the entrance to P. Place and the nice pub turn left).  Head out
of the village about half a mile and there's a vineyard and kind of zoo
on the road off to the right.  I think there are signs for the
vineyard.  PORC is on the same road as the vineyard but further up the
hill away from the village and on the left.  When you reach a steep hill
with woods on the left and a fireroad going up steeply towards the
trees, that's it.

Subject: Re: MTB centers

There is Wharncliffe/Greno woods just North of Sheffield. It has waymarked
trails, one of which is basically the old NEMBA XC course (when race
cources were worthy), some stunning downhill runs and enough fire roads to
keep the familly amused. The trans-pennine trail (national cycle network)
also runs through the wood.

email: darkandwhite@cwcom.net

There are no guides to the area, as far as I know, but there is a car park
with a map board and the start of the waymarked trails.

There are 2 waymarked trails at the moment, one on fire roads that is
designated easy, however even this has some steep descents and climbs. The
other is about 8 miles of mainly singletrack, some very steep indeed.
The whole area is a thickly wooded hill side about 7 miles long and about 2
miles from top to bottom. There are many fire roads and endless singletrack
routes, some waymarked as walks but many not marked at all. There are also
very few walkers (except dog walkers on the more major tracks).

By car, take the A61 either from Sheffield or the M1 J36. In Grenoside turn
off the A61, up the hill into the village (left from Sheffield, right from
M1). At "Main Street" turn right up the hill through the woods. The car
park is on the left just before the top of the hill.

By train, the nearest station is Chapeltown, on the Sheffield to
Huddersfield/Leeds line. Go down the steps from the station to the road. Go
right and immediately right at the roundabout. After about half a mile pick
up the trans-pennine trail on the left and this takes you to the area and
eventually the same car park.

Myra,

I thought that I'd mention some Northern English centres (or centers) for
riding. All are Forestry Commission places and I believe that they have a
website - but I don't know the address.

Delamere Forest, Chesire
Gisburn Forest, East Lancashire
Grizedale Forest, South Cumbria
Boltby Forest, North Yorkshire
Kielder Forest, South West Northumberland

All of these have waymarked trails and many have bike hire centres. Though
if people are able to navigate then I'd add:

Ambleside, Central Cumbria - Start at Biketreks
Keswick, Northern Cumbria - Start at Keswick MTB
Wharfedale, North Yorkshire - Start at the New Inn

The Forestry Commission in Scotland does a lot of waymarked trails in
Forests, but often there are no hire facilities, some I've used are near:

Crinan
Loch Awe, Southern End

Hope that this helps,

For Cannock I suggest you just turn up and set off in any direction - you
should soon find some interesting trails. There are three waymarked trails
but these are rather dull fireroads mainly. Whereabouts in Bham are you

The New Forest - Has waymarked trails and also a specially produced MTB map

I mean, at Guisborough you can roll gently along the old

staff there are very helpful, too - I spent a morning there marking my map
(OS Leisure 28) up with the permissive cycle routes and UCRs that aren't
shown on it.

I suppose I know the south-east part best, from Ashburton as far north as
Moretonhampstead and Drewsteignton. There's lots of good riding here, but
also further west. This is about as far as I can easily ride from home
(Exeter) and I hate putting the bike in the car! I don't really know the
area around Okehampton, I've only ever ridden a few bits there.

I like exploring, so I don't usually bother with guide books, especially as
the routes I have seen in some are often either illegal or crap. They often
seem to be, say, a circular route when a figure-eight would be far better!

If you get the DNP leaflets (cost you £1.25), the route through Manaton is
mostly unrideable in that direction - do it in reverse. Also the bit on the
Moretonhampstead leaflet over Foxworthy Bridge is a walk in that direction
but great fun the other way round. Some of the other bits that I know are
rideable but better in reverse.

If you want more info, shout!

> Delamere Forest, Chesire

2x1.5 mile forest playground. Undulating and intricate. Small size 
means you're never far from a road, but maybe not the one you expected. 
Can be unpleasantly busy nice weekends, best early/midweek.

Official status: Single wide gravel travel through the middle. 
Un-officially littered with fireroad, singletrack and tracks yet to be. 
Well tolerated. More recently 2 or 3 heavily manufactured play areas, 
courtesy of the folding spade. Dual courses the latest thing. Again, 
remarkably well-tolerated. Crackdown a couple of years ago came to 
nothing. Corralling the car parking is the new obsession. Two OK cafes 
and train station.

Myra,

I have a leafet from the Forest Enterprise, called Cycling in the Forest
West of Scotland which has cycling routes from Kintyre in the south to
Lochaber in the north and on Mull. The ones I've done are 1) alongside Loch
Awe in the Inverinan Forest near Dalavich. This is called the Two Lochs
Route and starts from Barnaline and heads north east to pick up the side of
Loch Awe and then crossed over and around to Loch Avich. 2) the Forest
immediately south of Crinan. I joined the blue and red routes together to
make it a bit longer. The red route goes to the Faery Isles and the blue
climbs up above Crinan to follow the Sound of Jura and then across to
Tayvallich and back.

I found both of them a bit tame. Lots of fire track and not much else. Still
it was good to be out and most of the forest was not too thick, so you can
get a view of the wonderful scenery.

I picked up this leaflet from the TIC in Lochgilphead, but the addresses on
the rear of the leaflet for more details are:

Kintyre Forest District and Loch Awe Forest District tel 01546 602518
Lorne Forest District 01631 566155
Lochaber Forest District tel 01397 702184
Mull Forest District tel 01680 300346

Note the Lochaber office also covers the Great Glen route.

I hope that this helps. I can recommend a campsite in that west coast area.
It is based at Arduaine halfway between Crinan and Oban, just south of
Kimelford. It is a small site that is used by touring cyclists, divers, and
sea canoeists. It has a sea beach frontage and is quite, and has wonderful
views over the islands.

Myra,

I've just got round to reading Friday's Digest. I would have said
Dartmoor should be in the Honeypot category, and Woodbury Common and
Haldon Hill can't find it listed, but I'm sure I mentioned it) maybe
in the MTB centres .

Also, although not an MTB centre, the Forest of Bere is nearby and has a
small (1/2hr riding) purpose built MTB track. There are a lot of gravel
paths that you can ride too, and a family cycle trail. I'll get some details
together as well for you to have a look at.

Sorry Neil, it's a bit late I know but that's wot happens when you take 5
days outa the office !!

Next time you're down, give me a bell and I'll try and help you out. The
Chase is our playground, and whilst I might not be up to the big boys
standards, the trails round there are OK for a day out !

I still havent found a way to subscribe or submit to MTB-UK without
filling my work inbox but i still follow the threads.  I noticed your
MTB centre info and the responses and thought i could add a little
info:

Honeypots - The Isle of Wight has a ludicrous concentration of
bridleways in a small area (is it something like 250miles ?) and even
in the middle of summer it's not crowded. Surprisingly hard as well
though rolling hills rather than mountainous.

Someone suggested the Brecons - whilst theres some great riding, most
of Wales suffers from the opposite problem to 'Wight - there are very
few Bridleways and those that exist dont link up that well.

I'll put another vote in for the North Downs but the whole area does
get very crowded both with walkers and bikers.

You have Brighton down as unknown status - The South Downs is a great
ride but even though marked still needs good map reading.  Theres a
stack of loops up, down and around the downs but the chalk gets deadly
in the wet.

Cheers

>>We always stay at a place called Ferndale, it is on the Karrimore trail
about 2 miles from the Coed-y-Brenin centre . give them a ring on 01341

	Best way I've found is : A580 to M6, M6 to M56, M56 to A55 ( end of
M56 ), A494 through Ruthin, Bala to Dolgellau, North on A470 from Dolgellau.
Don't go throught Llangollen, it looks good on the map but takes time.. OK?
