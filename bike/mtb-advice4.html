<h1> A beginner's guide to buying a mountain bike</h1>

<h2>Make sure it fits</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> It is of the utmost importance to buy a bike that fits you. If the
bike doesn't fit, don't buy it, even if you find a bike that's really
great at a low price. A bike that doesn't fit will annoy you every
time you ride it, and will get in the way when you get out on the
trails.  </p>

<p> First, I recommend that you read Peter White's excellent 
<a href="http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fitting.htm">article</a>
on bicycle fit. </p>

<p> Now I'll give some specific tips about getting a mountain bike
that fits you well. There are two main things to consider when getting
a bike that fits you. They are height of bike (usually determined by
seat tube length) and length of bike (usually determined by top tube
length). </p>

<p> Bike frame sizes usually bear some relation to the length of their
seat tubes (i.e., they tell you something about the height of the
bike). But what is the length of the seat tube? The entire length of
it, or from say the middle of the bottom bracket to the middle of the
top tube? Haro bikes often have curved top tubes, does their frame
size number take that into account? Are the seat tube extensions in
Kona bikes included in the frame size?  Different manufacturers do
things differently, so don't treat the numbers as any definite
indication of what bike will fit you best. You may think a frame size
sounds too small or large, but what's important is how you feel when
you're on it. The only thing that's certain is that given the same
model of bike in the same year, a larger number will mean a larger
bike.  </p>

<p> To start with, you need to ensure that you adequate crotch
clearance. Generally, you should be aiming at a minimum of 3 to 4
inches. Because mountain bikes are designed to allow this sort of
crotch clearance, they are generally very long for their height. Even
if you aren't planning on riding your mountain bike offroad (there are
reasons to do this: mountain bikes make good touring bikes, especially
for shorter people) you must allow a large amount of crotch clearance
to get the appropriate saddle to handlebar distance. If you know the
size of a road bike that fits you, you should be getting a mountain
bike that has a "frame size" (seat tube height) of at least 2"
smaller. </p>

<p> This is only the beginning. Now you must look closely at the
relative position of the handlebar with respect to the saddle. The
best position for you depends on how upright you like to be when
riding. Do you want a stretched-out, low-handlebars position (best for
maximum speed)? Or an upright position (better for control on
downhills and more comfortable for longer rides)? If you're like most
of us, you'll want something in between. </p>

<p> If you're not sure what position will suit you best, you will want
to ride a few bikes around to see what you like. The main thing you
should look for is feeling balanced. You shouldn't feel too stretched
out. This can put too much weight on your hands, which will make your
hands tired and can make the bike likely to nosedive (throwing you
over the bars) going downhill and off dropoffs.  On the other hand,
you shouldn't be too upright, as this can lead to a feeling of being
cramped (if the handlebar is too close). Also the higher center of
gravity can give you less control over the bike since you can't
maneuver your weight around well enough. As a general guide, most of
the people I ride with are into recreational cross-country riding, and
they usually have handlebars that are at the level of the saddle or a
bit below. If you want to race, you may want the handlebars
lower. </p>

<p> The relative position of handlebars and saddle are affected by
several things: the length of the top tube, the height of the head
tube, the angle and reach of the stem, and the type of handlebars.
Different bikes can offer quite a difference of positions, so try out
quite a few bikes before you buy. If you like a more upright position,
look for a bike with features like a shorter top tube, a stem that is
higher (larger angle between head tube and stem, which makes the
handlebars higher) or shorter (which brings the handlebars closer to
you), and riser bars. </p>

<p> Keep in mind that most bikes are designed with the average person
is mind. However, some people have much longer legs than average, some
have much longer torsos that average. It used to be part of bike lore
that women usually felt to stretched out on bikes because they tend
the have proportionally longer legs and shorter torsos, but it turns
out that this isn't the case: the real problem is that smaller bikes
(which smaller women need to ride) tend to have proportionally longer
top tubes than larger bikes, so the handlebars tend to end up further
from the saddle. (For more on this see
<a href="womens-fit.html">Buying a bike that fits a woman</a>.) </p>

<p> If you have a short torso with respect to your height, or if you
are small and thus ride a small bike (which tend to have
proportionally longer top tubes), you'll want to find ways of bringing
the handlebars back towards you. It may be simply a matter of putting
on a shorter stem (this is easy to do as MTB stems almost always have
well-positioned bolt to let you swap them without disturbing anything
mounted on the handlebars). If this doesn't work (you find that the
steering is too quick with the shorter stem, or the bars are still too
far away) you'll have to look for a bike with a shorter top tube. You
could buy a smaller size bike to get a shorter top tube. This usually
works reasonably well, as you'll end up with more crotch clearance.
You can run into trouble, however, with finding the handlebars too
low, which if it's not too low may be fixed by changing the stem for
one with a higher rise. Note also that different bikes tend to have
different lengths of top tube, so you can choose one that suits your
needs better. For example, you might consider the Fisher Tassajara
over the Fisher Kaitai because the former have shorter top tubes. </p>

<p> If you are small, finding a shorter top tube can be made easier by
the womens specific bikes that many manufacturers are making. These
bikes have several adaptations for the smaller riders that work as well
for shorter men as for short or even average-sized women. They have
shorter top tubes, suspension settings for lighter weight, sometimes
brake levers with reduced pull. </p>

<p> However, don't assume that all bikes labelled as "women's
specific" are going to be appropriate for a women or small man rider.
Some of them, for example the Trek and Juliana bikes, are very well
thought out fpr the needs of the smaller rider. Many so-called women's
specific bikes are way too heavy and offer a ridiculously upright
riding position, or really don't have short top tubes. To see a more
thorough discussion of women's bikes and components, see <a
href="what_women.html">What to look for in a women's bike</a>. </p>

<p> If you have a long torso with respect to your leg length, you may
find the distance to the handlebars too short. One thing you could do
is buy a larger framed bike to get a longer distance between you and
the handlebars, but this is not at all recommended. Crotch clearance
is essential for safe off-road riding.  You can replace the stem with
a longer stem, but on many bikes this results in slow steering, as it
increases the distance from the end of the handlebar (where your hand
rests) and the pivot point (the end of the stem that meets the head
tube). However, recent trends in mountain bike geometry (pioneered by
Fisher with its Genesis geometry) are in your favor. The trend
involves somewhat longer top tubes, which enables you to have a
shorter stem (which speeds up the steering) and still have the
handlebars the same distance from the saddle. In your case, you can
then put a longer stem on to get the handlebars out to a good
position. </p>

<p> Most modern MTBs come with 175mm cranks. This is too long for many
people, and too short for some. For more info on this, see my <a
href="cranks.html">article on cranks</a>. The chart to the right has
leg lengths (crotch to floor in bare feet) in the left column and
suggested crank lengths for MTBs on the right. Note that this chart is
adapted from the chart in my cranks article, by adding 5mm to each
crank length in the original chart. This reflects the fact that MTBers
tend to use longer cranks than road riders. Note that the
industry-standard 175mm cranks actually are ideal for only a very small
segment of the population. Taller than that you'll benefit from longer
cranks, and shorter than that you'll benefit from shorter cranks. </p>

<p> Measure your leg length (the <a href="cranks.html">cranks
article</a> shows you how) and see where you fit on this chart, and
compare this with the crank length on the bike you're thinking of
buying. If the suggested crank length is a sizeable distance (5mm or
more) from what's on the bike, it will benefit you to get different
length cranks. </p>

<p> Some length cranks are easier to find than others.  If your ideal
crank length is 170mm, you are in luck. All Shimano cranks come in
either 170mm or 175mm, so if the bike comes with 175mm cranks, ask
your bike shop to swap the cranks for an equivalent 170mm crank.  They
may charge you a small fee to do this, especially if the cranks they
take off aren't the same brand as the ones they put on, but it will
make pedalling much more stressful on your knees, and it will well and
truly be worth it. </p>

<p> If the suggested crank length is less than 170mm or greater than
175mm, it can be hard to get exactly what fits you. The shimano Deore
XT cranks offer the widest variety I know of: they come in lengths 
165/167.5/170/172.5/175/177.5/180mm. Even if your suggested crank
length is less than 165mm, or greater than 180mm, it would be very
beneficial for you to have a crank length that comes as close to your
ideal as you can. I know this is alot of money (these XT cranks aren't
cheap) but if you're a serious cyclist, it willd definitely be worth
it. Note that it can be difficult to get these non-standard lengths of
cranks. For example, 165mm versions weren't available in the UK. But
you can order them from the US. See the <a href="cranks.html">cranks
article</a> for more info. </p>

<p> If you have very short legs and can't afford a 165mm Deore XT
chainset, then if your bikes comes with 175mm cranks, at the very
least get them swapped for 170mm cranks. It won't be optimal for you,
but it will be far better than sticking with the extremely long cranks
that came with the bike. </p>
