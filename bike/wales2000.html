<p> It was Sunday, July 9th, 2000. I loaded the last bits into my
BOB trailer, hitched it to my old Trek 950 mountain bike, kissed Simon
goodbye, and rolled off down the road. I didn't return to Cambridge
until the 4th of August. In the intervening time I rode 715 miles,
both on and off-road, and met some wonderful people. </p>

<p> The plan was to tour Wales, checking out the good areas for
MTBing, getting between them via bike. I had slick tires for road
riding and knobblies for off-road, and the BOB to carry my stuff. My
schedule for the first week was determined by the need to be in <a
href="llanwrtyd.html">Llanwrtyd Wells</a>, mid-Wales, on the afternoon
of Saturday the 15th. That was the day of the <a
href="bog-snork.html">MTB Bog Snorkelling World Championships</a>, and
also the day I began my week-long stay in the Neuadd Arms Hotel. I
wanted to check out the off-road riding in the Forest of Dean on the
way, and also spend a day in Cardiff. </p>

<p> So this was my schedule: </p>

<p> Sunday & Monday: cycle to Forest of Dean <br>
Tuesday: cycle in the Forest of Dean <br>
Wednesday: cycle to Cardiff <br>
Thursday: cycle in Cardiff <br>
Friday and Saturday morning: cycle to Llanwrtyd Wells </p>

<p> The Forest of Dean is roughly 160 miles from Cambridge. I wanted to
stay in Youth Hostels, and the nearest one to the halfway point was in
Charlbury, which I estimated to be about 100 miles from Cambridge!
Hmmm, not ideal, doing a century on the first day of a tour. But I did
it. It was a long haul. Nothing really interesting happened, aside
from seeing a collection of stags, all with very impressive antlers,
at the Woburn Safari Park. I pulled up the the Charlbury youth hostel
about 9:15pm, having ridden 95 miles. They had plenty of rooms
available for that night, but they were fully booked with school
groups both the previous and next nights. I began to wonder if I was
going to be able to use youth hostels that much on this trip. I had
the youth hostel guy ring up the hostels near the Forest of Dean. They
were fully booked the next night, so it looked like I'd be staying in
a B&B. </p>

<p> The next day (Monday July 10th) I cycled through the Cotswalds,
getting thoroughly drenched by some very heavy rain. In
Stow-on-the-Wold I visited the tourist infomation center and got them
to book me a B&B on the edge of the Forest of Dean. Unfortunately it
was the west edge of the forest, so I had to cycle through it to get
there. The B&B was run by a lady who had an enthusiatic and friendly
dog named Charlie. </p>

<p> On Tuesday (July 11th), despite my desire to see the Forest of Dean, I
was beat, I had a very sore bum, and it was raining. I was decidedly
lacking in ehthusiasm. So I played tourist, visiting the local iron
mine and a little patch of primeval-looking trees called Puzzle
Wood. Then finally the sun came out and I was inspired to put
knobblies on the bike and check out the forest. So I rode around the
woods, finding a scary downhill that was just on the edge of my
abilities, a skills area with lots of little slopes and twisty tracks,
some very wide smooth family cycling tracks, and one very nice
singletrack. Satisfied, I went back to the B&B and spent some time
talking to the B&B owner and trying to stop Charlie from jumping on
me. </p>

<p> On Wednesday (July 12th) I put the slicks back on the bike and cycled
to Cardiff. The highlight of this leg was the Newport Transporter
bridge. Basically it's a very tall girdered structure stretched over
the River Usk. Underneath this, hanging from some cables, is a small
platform that carries cars and pedestrians back and forth across the
river. I'd never seen anything like this. I came into Cardiff and
bought a map so I could find the house of David Owens, my host for the
next couple of days. I met David through a newsgroup, when I'd sold
him my Thudbuster (a suspension seatpost). I mentioned that I was
going to Wales, and he very kindly invited me to stay with him and his
family. I negociated the Cardiff streets and found the Owens
residence, and was very rapidly made to feel welcome. </p>

<p> On Thursday (July 13th) I went for a ride with Danny and Roger,
friends of David. We took the train to Treherbert, then rode back to
Cardiff on Sustans route 47 and the Taff trail. There was some nice
scenery, and we had the pleasure of eating lunch in a tiny village
consisting of one pub and one church - no houses! The only downer of
the day was that I managed to get two punctures riding on the rocky
dirt roads that route 47 followed. The first was a pinch flat, and the
second was due to sidewall damage of the tire. That's what I get for
using slick tires off-road, I thought. (Hmmm, Danny and Roger were
using slick tires too and they didn't get any punctures. Maybe it was
just bad luck!) That evening I went to see the movie Chicken Run with
the Owens family. </p>

<p> On Friday (July 14th) I left Cardiff, sad to be leaving a place where
I'd felt so at home, and headed to Brecon. Or to be more exact, I went
to a B&B in a small village outside of Brecon. This involved a fair
bit of up and down. The nicest bit was a long, slightly-downhill bit
of the Taff trail along the edge of the Talybont reservoir. This part
offered some nice views and good speeds. </p>

<p> On Saturday (July 15th), after a slight navigational error
(confusing west with east) I was on my way through Brecon. I went over
a big MOD firing range, down a long steep hill, and showed up in
Llanwrtyd Wells in plenty of time to make it to the <a
href="bog-snork.html">bog snorkelling competition</a>. Afterwards I
went back to town and checked into the hotel, where I'd be spending
the next week. </p>

<h4>Week 2</h4>

<blockquote>

<p> The entire week I spent in <a
href="llanwrtyd.html">Llanwrtyd Wells</a> was sunny and hot. Many
people think of Wales as being unrelentingly wet and cold, but I've
had pretty good luck in my visits there. Every day I spent at
Llanwrtyd Wells I went out MTBing, usually riding 20 to 30 miles. Some
of the routes were from the Llanwrtyd Wells Cycle Guide, which is
sponsored by the CTC. One was a published route from a magazine, and
one I made up on my own, although it covered some of the tracks from
the Cycle Guide. </p>

<p> On my first full day there (Sunday the 16th) I went out riding
with some magazine routemeisters whom I'd met in the bar the previous
evning: Tom Hutton, Mountain Bike Rider routes editor, and his riding
buddy Tim Salveson. We did a nice route in the forests south of
Llanwrtyd Wells. The next couple of days (Monday July 17and Tuesday
July 18th) I did CTC routes 4 (Irfon Forest) and 5 (Mynydd
Trawsnant). Route 4 I did on my own. It was really tops, except for
the boring fire road climb at the beginning. There were some great
bits of singletrack and some tricky descents. Route 5 I rode with
Pete, a fellow I'd see hanging around the hotel with a mountain bike
the previous evening. It had some nice tracks, but overall it wasn't
as good. </p>

<p> On Wednesday (July 20th) I did a really great route. I had
found it as an MBR route on the wall of the bar and contemplated doing
it, and independently one of the guys at the bar recommended it to
me. It was a 30 mile route through forests, around Llyn Briane, and
through the amazingly scenic Doethie Valley. The track through the
valley was worth it all: it was narrow and contoured along the side of
the valley. </p>

<p> Over the next couple of days (Thursday July 20th and Friday July 21st)
I worked out a route for GoFar (www.gofar-mtb.com), a Web-based
magazine I regularly contribute to. Then finally, it was time to go. I
didn't have any idea of where to go from there, so I asked Gordon Green
for advice. He suggested that I follow the Lon Las Cymru, the Welsh
National Cycle Route and Sustrans Route 8, to the north. There are two
versions of it in several places. The more difficult, more off-road,
and unsigned posted bit of it headed north from Llanwrtyd Wells. </p>

<p> So that's what I did for the next three days (Saturday July 22nd
though Monday July 24th). The route proved to be quite
challenging. Sustrans tried very hard to avoid roads larger than small
lanes, resulting in some very hilly roads and some quite rough
off-road bits. I'd left the knobbly tires on my bike, and I was glad
of it. The good weather held out, keeping me warm as I rode between
B&Bs and youth hostels. I was treated to some spectacular scenery,
some long difficult climbs, steep pushes, and some hairy decents with
the trailer. </p>

<p> On Saturday (July 22nd) I managed to miss a turn on the Lon Las
Cymru and ended up riding on this rutted track that forded a small
stream a few dozen times. At first I was being careful and pushing the
bike through the edge of the fords where they were shallower.
Eventually I gave up and just put the bike in a low gear and rode
right through. Still, when puddles of unknown depth covered the byway,
I preferred to push the bike around rather than ride through. Since
the grass beside the byway was generally quite damp this often
involved hauling the bike and trailer through sticky mud. This was
real work, and I was going very slowly. My OS map told me that the
path I was on crossed the official path, so when I came to an
intersection with a wide, smooth forest track, I verified (comparing
real life to the map) that this was the right way, and I took
it. Finally the miles began to accumulate again even if slowly, and
they went even faster on the tarmac bits that I eventually got to.  On
one of these tarmac bits I met another biker who was doing the same
route as I was, and we compared notes on the route. By 5:30pm I'd only
gone about 33 miles, but I was tired so I checked into a B&B for the
night. </p>

<h4>Week 3</h4>

<p> On Sunday (July 23nd) I continued along the Lon Las Cymru. There
were two really difficult bits on the route. First was that in the
middle of a not-very steep off-road climb there was a locked gate. I
waited a bit in hopes that someone would come along and give me a
hand, but of course I hadn't seen anyone on the route the entire day
long, so I resigned myself to doing it myself. I unhooked the trailer
from the bike and lifted the bike over the gate, no problem there. But
I couldn't just lift the trailer over the fence then let it fall to
the ground; I'd probably bend it. I lifted it up, somehow managed to
balance it on top of the metal fence while I climbed over, then let it
down on the ther side. Arrggghhh. The second difficult bit was a
stretch of quite loose, rocky descents. I went slowly but stil crashed
several times. Each time I picked myself up, got back on, and headed
down again... At the bottom of this I came across the biker (Steve)
I'd met the previous day. We spent the rest of the day together. We
said he was going to the Centre for Alternative Technology. I didn't
have any plans, so I figured I'd go along as well. The CAT is meant to
inspire people to live more sustainable by cycling and taking public
transport, recycling, putting more insulation in their houses,
etc. After that we went to the Corris Youth Hostel, where he had
booked a bed. There were very few women, so I got a women's bunk room
all to myself. </p>

<p> On Monday (July 24th) I parted company with Steve: he was heading
west and I north. After another difficult off-road bit I rolled into
Dolgellau and decided to see what sort of riding was on offer besides
the obvious Coed-Y-Brenin just to the north. I enquired at a local
bike shop and got my map suitably highlighted. I checked into a B&B,
asking for a room for the next three nights, leaving me two full days
in Dolgellau. </p>

<p> On Tuesday (July 25th) I did a very nice ride that started out along
the Mawddach Estuary, went through Barmouth, then over a very big
hill, then back to Dolgellau. The first part was easy and flat, and I
stopped for a bit in Barmouth to watch people fishing for crabs from
the docks and building sand castles on the beach. When I finally
hauled myself away from this, the ride over the top was worth it. The
track was good and challenging and the views top-notch. Coming off the
big hill I had 3.5 miles of off-road then on-road descent, before a
short flat road bit back to Dolgellau. </p>

<p> On Wednesday (July 26th) it rained in the morning, and I was feeling a
bit lazy, so I went for a walk in the afternoon.  </p>

<p> On Thursday (July 27th) I headed north along the Lon Las Cymru through
Coed-Y-Brenin, where I saw lots of mountain bikers. I left the Lon Las
Cymru just north of Llyn Trawsfyndd, where I headed northeast towards
Betws-Y-Coed, and the LLC heads northwest towards Anglesey. Arriving
in Betws-Y-Coed after a few more hills, I found a B&B. Simon would be
joining me the next day, so I got a double room. I told him where it
was via the wonders of mobile phones. </p>

<p> On Friday (July 28th) I did my last MTB ride in Wales for this trip. I
started in the Gwydyr Forest northeast of Betws-Y-Coed, exploring
quite a variety of tracks. Eventually I emerged from the forest at
Llyn Crafnant. From here I tried to take a track that headed south
from the lake. I followed this for awhile, as it climbed and climbed,
but eventually it deteriorated into a barely discernible, very rocky,
completly unridable and barely walkable track that clung to a
hillside. If the track continues some other way, I couldn't find
it. Eventually I gave up. There was another track that headed south
from the lake, and rather than going all the way back to the lake
to pick that up, I tried cutting across. I succeeded, but it involved
carrying the bike down a rather steep and loose patch of slate, and
walking through a through a sheep field. Finally I was on the right
track: this one was mostly ridable. However, it was getting quite
late, well after 5pm, and I expected Simon at the B&B at about that
time. I thought Simon would be worried, wondering where I was. Since I
was tired I was being conservative in what I would try, so it was
taking even longer to get over the big hill that lay between me and
civilization. Finally, I heard the roar of cars along the A5, and soon
I was zooming along it with them towards Betws-Y-Coed. I arrived at
the B&B just as Simon was parking the car! Evidently he'd been
concerned that I'd be angry at him for being late, just as I was
concerned that he'd be worrying about me because I was late. We both
laughed and kissed our hellos, after not seeing each other for almost
three weeks. </p>

<h4>Week 4</h4>

<blockquote>

<img align="right" width=228 height=350 src="travel/wales/NYMoors-sm.jpg">

<p> The next couple of days (Saturday July 29th and Sunday July 30th) we
did some sightseeing and went for walks. On Monday (July 31st) we
drove to Scotland for a wedding which was on Tuesday. On Wednesday
(August 2nd) we drove to the North York Moors, where Simon left me at
the house of a MTBing friend, John, who lives near Danby. Simon went
back to Cambridge, and soon three other MTBers showed up. Many beers
and a couple of bottles of wine were consumed as we talked the gears
and tracks of mountain biker geek talk. </p>

<p> On Thursday (August 3rd) we went for a tour of the Moors, as John
called it. It was a 41 mile ride designed to take in nice tracks and
good scenery, and to avoid the nasty climbs that you can find on the
edges of the valleys. We had lunch at the Lion Inn, rode lots of great
twisty, heathery, occasionally rocky singletrack. After the ride, two
of the guests went home, leaving only Arthur and me. </p>

<p> On Friday (August 4rd) Arthur rode to Malton, the nearest train
station that has trains directly to York. I went for a short ride with
John in the morning. We hit some of his favorite bridleways, including
a very good rocky one right behind his house. That afternoon John and
his wife drove me to Malton (yeah, OK, I'm lazy), and from there I
took the train back to Cambridge, ending my holiday. </p>
