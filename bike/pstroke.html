<h2>How to go up hills easier: improve your spin!</h2>

<p> A better pedal stroke is your key to going up hills faster and
easier.  Many people resort to a push-push kind of stroke when going
up hills, which is very tiring and doesn't work nearly as well. You
can tell if you're one of these people with a bad pedal stroke by
paying attention to your body as you go up hills. People with bad
pedal strokes will notice that their upper body sways when they pedal
seated up hills.  When they push down with the left foot, their upper
body will move to the left to exert more pressure. This will not
happen with people with a good spin, because they aren't putting all
their effort into pushing, but instead onto making their pedal stroke
smooth and even. I guarantee you that if you fix your pedal stroke,
you will go up hills easier. It also gives you something to think
about as you are climbing, which makes the hills seem to go by
quicker: you pay attention to your body, feeling your legs, trying to
keep things as smooth as possible. And then when you get to the top,
you'll look behind you and see that you've left most of your fellow
riders far behind. I'm not kidding. It works that well.</p>

<p> The best thing I've done for my pedal stroke was a trick taught me
by Penn Cycling Team coach Pete Durdaller. Find a flat road with light
traffic. In Philly, this is West River Drive on the weekends. Then
pedal with only one foot, holding the other one out.  This works best
with clipless pedals, but if you don't have your straps too loose, it
probably could work with toeclips as well. You can't do this for very
long because it's very tiring.  What I would do is pedal about 15
strokes on each leg, do 3 reps of this, then just pedal regularly for
awhile before doing it again. The first time I tried this, my pedaling
motion was incredibly jerky. But I stuck with it, and concentrated on
it (this is why you need the low traffic), and eventually I got it
more or less smooth. This teaches you the feel of smooth pedalling.
Once your legs learn what it feels like, you can do it when you're
pedaling with both legs. </p>

<p> Another things that helps is to make sure that you're pulling back
at the bottom of you pedal stroke.  Think about scraping mud off the
bottom of your shoes after a muddy walk. This is more or less what
should be happening at the bottom of your pedal stroke. </p>

<p>
Keep it up, and soon you'll find that hills aren't nearly as bad as
before.</p>
