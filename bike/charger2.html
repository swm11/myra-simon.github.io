fast charging and describes how my boyfriend and I modified a Black
and Decker "1 hour" power tool charger to work with bike
batteries. Part 2 is Marty Goodman's excellent article on DeWalt power
tool chargers (DeWalt and Black & Decker chargers are made by the same
company). </p>

<h1>PART 1: Making a NiCad Bike Battery Charger</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> The best way to charge a NiCads battery is with a constant
current. This is easily arranged, however the problem is when to stop
charging it.  </p>

<p> The rate you charge a battery at is given in multiples of C, where
C is the capacity of your battery in amp-hours. For example, C/2 for a
5 amp-hour battery would be a current of 2.5 A. If you charge the
battery at a rate higher than C/10, and you don't stop charging it
when the battery is full, the excess energy goes into producing heat,
and this can permanently damage your battery. If you charge the
battery at a rate lower than C/10 (which is the rate used by most
chargers that come supplied with bike lights), then the excess heat is
dissipated quickly enough that it won't do any permanent damage to the
battery. However you can still get "voltage depression" effects in
your battery. (Read <a
href="http://www.antonbauer.com/tech/handbook.html#voltagetech">this</a>
to find out all about voltage depression.) Now, if your battery is
empty when you attach it to a C/10 charger, it will be charged in
about 14 hours (you might think it should be 10 hours, but charging
isn't 100% efficient), so if you unplug it then you'll be fine, right?
Well, no, because your battery will never be completely empty when you
go to recharge it. (If it is, then you're doing something very very
wrong, as fully discharging a battery is a very good way to kill it.)
So you need to reduce the charge time proportionally to account for a
partly charged battery. However, you probably don't have a good handle
on how much capacity you've used up, especially if you've been
stopping and starting (and turning off lights when stopped), and if
you've been using varying light levels. </p>

<p> So what you need is a smart charger. Smart chargers detect when a
battery is full and turn off the power (actually, they usually switch
to a very low current to prevent self-discharge). You can detect when
the battery is full by measuring the temperature of the battery or
voltage of the battery. The temperature version works exactly because
after a battery is full, addition current sent into it is converted to
heat. So when the temperature rises, the battery is full, so turn
off. The voltage relies on an interesting feature of NiCads: as you
charge it, the voltage of the battery steadily rises. When the battery
is full, the voltage drops off slightly! So you measure the voltage of
the battery at regular intervals and stop charging when you find that
the voltage has dropped between measurements. </p>

<p> The ideal charger would use both temperature and voltage
measurements to decide when to turn off, but batteries that you
get with bike lights don't have thermometors (technically, thermistors)
in them, so you're stuck with the voltage-only approach. </p>

<p> DeWalt power tool chargers to the rescue. Lots of power tools
(drills, screwdrivers, saws, etc) run on rechargeable NiCad power
packs. To recharge them, they sell very nice chargers. These chargers
have a slot in them especially shaped to hold the case of the
power tool battery. To use them to charge bike batteries, you just
have to open up the case and solder on a cord that matches your
battery. </p>

<p> See below (Part 2) for the guide to DeWalt chargers. Make sure you
get one with only two contacts; if you find a charger with more than
two, they are sensing temperature, and this won't work for your
battery. </p>

<p> Each DeWalt charger puts out a certain amount of current. They
work best when this current is between about C and C/3.5 amps, where C
is the capacity of your battery in amp-hours. Put another way, if your
charger puts out current <i>a</i>, then you can charge batteries with
a capacity between <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> * 3.5 amp-hours. Since my
Black & Decker charger puts out 1.9 A, I can use it to charge
batteries with capacity between 1.9 amp-hours and 6.65 amp-hours. </p>

<p> These chargers can be used for a very wide range of voltages.
Although the power tool batteries that my charger was
intended to charge have a limited range of voltages (7.2V to 13.2V), the
charger is actually capable of charging batteries from 1.2V to 24V
(according to the included instruction manual). </p>

<p> <b>Preventing shocks.</b> In attaching the cord to the charger, we
took Marty's warning about the shock hazard (see below in Part 2) very
seriously, especially as the mains electricity here in the UK is
240V. We wanted to make sure that we couldn't touch the contacts of
the battery or charger while the charger was in operation. A careful
inspection of the barrel connectors that attach to our lights
(VistaLite and NiteRider) indicated that this connector couldn't be
used for charging. So this is the solution we came up with.  We use
race pack connectors (used for connecting NiCad battery packs to
remote controlled cars) to attach the battery to the charger. They are
good for this purpose because all metal bits are surrounded by
insulating plastic. When the batteries are done charging, we attach a
power cord (which has a race pack connector on one end and the
appropriate barrel connector on the other end) to the battery and plug
this into the lighting heads. This has the advantage that, in addition
to making charging much safer, we can now swap our power cords around
easily. We have three power cords made up: two with only one plug on
the end (one with expanding "curley cord", one with straight cord),
and one that ends in two plugs for powering two lighting heads. </p>

<p> Our thus modified charger works very well, except for the annoying
fact that our Black & Decker "1 hour" charger has a timeout at 1.5
hours, at which point it holds the LED charge indicator steady to say
that the charge is done. Thus if we just plug in the battery and leave
it to charge for several hours, when we come back we don't know if it
has timed out or if it terminated the charge because the battery was
full. The best solution seems to be to set the charger going, and to
come back about every hour and check it. If it's still charging, we
unplug the battery briefly to reset the timer before plugging it in to
continue the charge.  This annoying feature seems to be unique to my
Black & Decker charger. Many people on the bikecurrent mailing list
have made bike battery chargers out of DeWalt chargers and no one else
has reported having this problem.</p>

<h1>PART 2: Guide to DeWalt Chargers</h1>

publications / services)</i></p>
 
<p> As many on BikeCurrent know, I've been recommending DeWalt power tool
chargers as a third party smart NiCd bicycle lighting battery recharger
for quite a while.  I've also noted that Black and Decker makes
identical equivalent chargers.</p>
 
</blockquote>

<h2>Important WARNING / Note:</h2>
 
<blockquote>

<p> The DC output to the NiCd battery of these power tool chargers is HOT
with respect to ground, to the tune of 110 volts AC, making it
imperative that modified chargers be set up and used with care and only
by knowledgeable tinkerers.   Touching the charger output, or touching
an exposed battery contact while the battery is connected to the
charger, can result in a startling, or painful, or even potentally (tho
fortunately very rarely) LETHAL shock IF you are also in contact with an
earth ground (cold wet stone floor, cold water pipe, etc.) at the same
time you touch the charger or battery contact.  Modified chargers should
be set up in a controlled area where children, pets, or curious adults
ignorant of the dangers they pose cannot get at them!  And should be
used BY the tinkerer with care and respect for this potential danger.
A knowledgeable tinkerer who is highly safety conscious can eliminate
this shock hazzard by powering their DeWalt 9104, 9106, 9107, or 9108
charger (or equivalent Black and Decker charger) via a 110 volt to 110
volt AC isolation transformer.</p>
 
 
<p> The model number I've mentioned most over the last two years was the
DW9106.  However, the venerable DW9106 has been discontinued.   Some
hardware stores and chains that carry DeWalt stuff MAY still have the
9106, and some of those MAY be closing them out at extra low prices.
The normal retail price on the DW9106 was around $45.  I picked up a
couple for $10 each a while back from one chain that was closing them
out.</p>
 
<p> The DW9104 is IDENTICAL to the 9106, except for one sensing resistor on
the circuit board.   This resistor, R2, is 13,000 ohms in the DW9016,
which is rated as having a 1.9 amp charging current.  R2 is 15,000 ohms
in the DW 9104, which is rated as having a 1.5 amp charging current.</p>
 
<p> Both the DW9104 and 9106 are rated to handle batteries from 7.2 thru
14.4 volts, tho in practice I've used them successfully with batteries
as low as 4.8 volts, and the technician at DeWalt, when I called about
this, told me he thought they could be used down to a single cell (1.2
volt) battery, but that in any case the could be used with confidence on
batteries down to 4 cells (4.8 volts), and that the rating on the
package reflected ONLY the fact that the batteries made by DeWalt
designed to fit in the hole in the charger were  made in votlages
ranging from 7.2 to 14.4 volts.  NOT due to 7.2 volts being the lower
limit of what the charger could handle.</p>
 
<p> I believe DeWalt made yet another model of charger for this line of
power tools, the DW 9105, I think,  which was designed to run off 12
volts DC.  If you can get such a charger at a good price, DO SO.  For by
powering it off a linear 12 volt DC wall source, you will eliminate any
shock hazzard!   And you will have the added advantage of being able to
use it on the road, powering it off your automobile's battery.</p>

<hr>
 
<p> DeWalt switched to a different physical style of battery and battery
contact.  These batteries had higher power capacities, and to charge
them quickly enough DeWalt completely redesigned their charger to put
out almost twice as much current as the old ones, as well as redesiging
the hole in the charger and the battery contact to fit the new line of
power tool batteries.</p>
 
<p> Their DW9107 was the first charger they put out (that I know of) in this
series.  It was rated to handle batteries from 9.6 thru 14.4 volts, but
works fine in my experience with batteries at least down to 6 volts (and
probably lower.  It puts out 2.8 amps of charging current during fast
charging.</p>
 
<p> The current model in this line that's being sold is the DW9108.  This
model puts out 2.8 amps of current when fast charging, and is rated to
handle batteries from 9.6 volts thru 18 volts. This current model is
available at Home Depot priced at $50.00 plus tax.   Its circuit board
is very similar to, but NOT identical to, that of the 9107.  There's an
extra chip on the board, and some minor circuit changes.  I have very
limited experience with the 9108, but have every reason to believe it
will handle the same range of batteries as the 9107.</p>
 
<p> I don't currently know what, if any, charger is made by DeWalt in the
same line as the DW 9107 and DW 9108 that will run off 12 volts DC.  If
they DO make one, it would be desireable because of the easy ability to
remove the shock hazzard from the charger, and to run the charger off a
car battery.  But it is also likely to be quite expensive, as such a
charger would require an added DC to DC converter to step UP the 12
volts DC for charging purposes.</p>

<p> Note: </p>
 
<p> The case of all four of these models, and of the Black and Decker
equivalent chargers, is held together with four SECURITY type torx
screws.  You need a T15 size SERCURITY type (hole drilled in the middle
of the bit) torx bit to open these cases up.  Such bits are widely
available at well-stocked hardware stores these days (tho in times past
were hard to obtain!). </p>
