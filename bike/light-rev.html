<h1>High-Power Lights Review</h1>

<p> This article has reviews of some halogen bulb-based high-powered
lighting systems, the type with separate lighting heads and batteries.
I make no attempt to be universal. I review here systems that I would
consider owning, and that I have enough experience with to be able to
give a reasonable opinion on. Since I have only used 6V systems, I
only review 6V systems. I haven't owned all of these systems, but have
at least (in most cases) seen them in use (on the weekday evening rides that
I regularly attend), and heard enough about them to be able to provide
an opinion on them.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.vistalite.com/vis2a.htm">
VistaLite 400 Series Lights</a></h2>

<p> VistaLite 420 and 430 systems are based on the VistaLite 400
lighting head. The VistaLite 400's plusses are that it has a very nice
quick release mount, and that it can be focussed from a narrow spot to
a wide angle. However, there are some significant disadvantages.
First, the 10W bulb included with the 420 and 430 lighting systems is
frosted, and this scatters the light, meaning that you have much less
light going where you want it to go. It also means that you can't
focus the lights very well. The bulb is frosted to make up for a
reflector that doesn't provide a very smooth beam. When you put in a
clear (unfrosted) bulb, you get dark rings in the light pattern.
However, experiments in a back garden demonstrate that an unfrosted 6W
bulb puts out about as much usable light as a frosted 10W bulb while
taking much less power to run. </p>

<p> Thus, if you can tolerate the rings, it seems sensible to use the
clear 6W bulb, or, of you want more light, the clear 10W
bulb. VistaLite no longer sells them, but Reflectalite makes bulbs
that will fit. The bulbs are £3 to £5 and are available from Edinburgh
Bicycle in the UK. In the US, try any caving supply shop, such as
<a href="http://www.caves.org/imo/">Inner Mountain Outfitters</a>. You're
looking for Mini Edison Screw (MES) bulbs, which are the same kind
that fit into 
<a href="http://www.petzl.com/headlamps.html">Petzl headlamps</a>
(though you want a different voltage). You want 6V halogen bulbs, 6W or 10W
(1A or 1.66A). </p>

<p> The batteries that come with the 420 and 430 series lights are Hawker
Engergy Cyclon Sealed lead-acid batteries. (See the technical article
as to why these batteries are so good.) The 420 (single head system)
has a 2.5 Ah battery, which the 430 (double head system) has a 5Ah
battery. The 430 battery, plus bag, weighs about 1.1 kg. It's a very
good system, and hard to beat for the money. Hence it is popular
on the night rides I go on. </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.vistalite.com/vis2b.htm">
VistaLite 500 Series Lights</a></h2>

<p> The VistaLite 500 head (included in the VistaLite 520, 530, and
540 lighting systems) is based on an MR-11 bulb. The 500 head is one
of the smallest and lightest: it is barely larger than the bulb
itself, and the mount is just a small plastic bracket the goes around
the handlebars. The bracket attaches with a thumbscrew. It does not
include a quick release feature, but it is so quick to put on and take
off that I don't miss it.</p>

<p> There is nothing in the housing to protect it from the heat of the
bulb, so the instructions are careful to state that you must keep
moving to keep the lighting head from overheating. They are not
guaranteed to be completely waterproof, but in actual use (including
riding in heavy rain) they are good enough, not noticeably letting any
water in. They can be mounted on a helmet with the proper accessory.</p>

<p> The heads are available with 10W or 15W bulbs in them, and VistaLite
sells a 5W one as well. The batteries are 4.5 Ah NiCad batteries,
either in the form of a water bottle or a padded pack that can be
strapped to the frame of your bike or worn as a bum bag.</p>

<p> The lighting systems based around the heads come in the following
forms: The VistaLite 520 comes with one 15W lighting head (head with
15W bulb) and a battery in a bag (or a water bottle battery). The
VistaLite 530 comes with one 15W lighting head, one 10W lighting head
and a battery in a bag (or a water bottle battery). The VistaLite 540
comes with two 15W lighting heads, one 10W lighting head, a battery in
a bag, and a battery in a water bottle.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.niterider.com/products/products.html">
NiteRider 6V Systems</a></h2>

<p> NiteRider seems to be trying very hard to add value to their
systems.  Usually high-powered lighting systems come with a battery, a
lighting head or two, and a stupid charger. NiteRider tries to do
better: some of their systems provide features like better
chargers, varying light levels, and a useful fuel guage. They also
provide excellent technical information with their lighting systems,
as well as on their
<a href="http://www.niterider.com/support/support.html">Web pages</a>.</p>

<p> NiteRider systems come in two basic varieties: 6V and 12V systems. The
6V systems come with a single lighting head and a single 6V battery.
The 12V systems come with a lighting unit that contains two bulbs
side-by-side, and one NiCad battery. I only have personal experience
with the 6V versions, so I will concentrate on them.</p>

<p> NiteRider uses MR-11 bulbs in their systems. The 6V bulbs are
exactly like those used in the VistaLite 500s, except that they have a
metal heat shield glued on the back of the bulb. This shield protects
the lighting head from the heat of the bulb, but it has the side
effect that the bulbs are not easily interchangeable between VistaLite
and NiteRider systems. The NiteRider 12V systems have 12V versions of
the MR-11 bulb.</p>

<p> All the 6V systems use the same style of lighting head. It is somewhat
larger that the VistaLite 500 head, but is reputed to be waterproof and
indestructible. It has a mount that you attach to the handlebars, and
then the lighting head clicks into place. Thus it is very easy and
quick to put on and take off, although to move it from one bike to
another you have to buy an additional mount or take the time to swap
the mount over.</p>

<p> You can get a variety of different batteries with these
systems. The more expensive models (Digital Pro-6 and Pro-6) come with
a 5 amp-hour NiCad battery in a water bottle (it weighs 810 grams) and
a 15W bulb. The Premium comes with a 15W bulb and a 5 amp-hour NiCad
battery in a padded bag that you wear as a bum bag or hang from your
frame. The Trail Rat comes with a 10W bulb and a 5 amp-hour lead-acid
battery in a padded bag. The Super Sport doesn't come with a battery,
but instead comes with a water bottle shaped battery holder that you
can put alkalines or NiCad cells into.</p>

<p> The chargers vary as well. The Trail Rat has a very good charger
that replentishes just the amount of battery power that has been
consumed.  The Digital Pro-6 has a timed charger that charges for a
modest rate for 14 hours, then switches over to a trickle charge.  The
others just have a charger that you have to unplug yourself after 14
hours. </p>

<p> The Digital Pro-6 has a processor that provides some additional
features. The most useful of these is the ablity to dim the light,
giving you lower power settings from the same light bulb. These lower
power settings are not all that efficient (for example, the 6W setting
will give you a great deal less light than a separate 6W bulb run at
full power), but they are useful if you don't want to carry around
extra lower-powered lighting heads.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.specialized.com/">Specialized Proview</a></h2>

<p> This comes in two flavors: an alkaline one and a NiCad (5 amp-hour)
one. It comes with a 12W 6V MR-11 bulb. There is a battery life
indicator that senses the voltage of the battery. It's useful when you
are running with alkaline batteries, as the voltage falls off steadily
with these batteries. But if you are using NiCad batteries, the
voltage remains more or less constant until the battery is nearly
exhausted, so by the time the LEDs have changed, you're pretty much
out of fuel.</p>

<p> They chose not to overvolt the bulb, in order to preserve the long
life of MR-11 bulbs. However, a Specialized representative assures me
that you can put other MR-11 bulbs in it, including VistaLite bulbs
(without a heat shield) and Niterider bulbs (which include a heat
shield) without modification. However, he suggests that you not put in
bulbs of more than 12W, since the additional heat of the brighter
bulbs may damage the battery life indicator circuit board and the
switch.</p>

<p> The charger that comes with the NiCad version is the standard stupid
charger that will harm your battery if you don't unplug it on time.</p>

<p> The main attraction of the Proview is that it's very reasonably priced.
Edinburgh Bicycle sells the alkaline version for £35.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cateye.com/MAIN.HTML">
Cateye NC-210 and NC-200</a></h2>

<p> Cateye specializes in good optics. In addition to the lights
described here, they make the astonishingly bright (and very
expensive) Stadium Light, and the much-praised Micro Halogen, a small
lightweight get-around-town light with a surprisingly bright beam.</p>

<p> The NC-210 lighting head produces a rectangular beam that is somewhat
wider than is is tall. It is similar in size to the central bright
spot of a 10 degree MR-11 bulb (as you get in VistaLite or NiteRider
10W bulbs). However, there is very little side-spill: the patterns on
the lens send the light into the central region. There are some
vertical stripes above and below the central rectangle, which may
annoy you if you're riding in fog.</p>

<p> The NC-200 is a dual-beam system which includes two individually
aimable lights in one mount. It is very reasonably priced, and
probably because of this, is a very popular lighting system among my
regular group of off-road night riders. One of the lights, the "broad
beam", is basically the same as the NC-210. The other is what it calls
a "spot beam", which gives a circular beam that is incredibly
narrow. It penetrates pretty far, showing good detail in a very small
area. This is great for showing what's ahead of you on a straight
trial, but it's nearly useless in showing you what's around corners,
which is so important for off-road riding. (However, this can be said
of almost all handlebar-mounted lights to some degree.) For road
riding, where you don't need to see road details quite so well, a
wider beam that shows more area would be more useful, so it might be
worth your effort to find another of the "broad beam" lights to
install in place of the "spot beam".</p>

<p> The stock system comes with a 6W bulb in the "broad beam" and a 10W
bulb in the "spot beam". However, you can get 2.4W, 6W, and 10W bulbs
for them, so you can customize the light settings.</p>

<p> The NC-200 comes with a 4 amp-hour lead-acid battery, while the NC-210
comes with a 3 amp-hour lead-acid battery. They both are supplied with
stupid chargers.

<h2><a href="http://www.night-sun.com/htmldocs/civilian.html">
NightSun SunSport</a></h2>

<p> I include this in my review (even though I have never seen it in
person and, as far as I can tell, it's not available in the UK)
because of the good press it has been getting in the bikecurrent
mailing list. Basically, it is (in my opinion) the ideal helmet
light. The bulb is an overvolted 6W MR-11 spot bulb, which is ideal
for lighting up turns while riding off-road. The lighting head
consists of a plastic piece molded around the bulb, and this snaps
into place on a plastic base. This base can be attached to a helmet
via straps though the vent holes, or just worn on the head via a
neoprene band (included). The battery is a very small and lightweight
2.5 amp-hour NiCad one consisting of 5 C cells shrink-wrapped
together. It doesn't come with a bag; you must put it in your bum bag
or water pack. The charger is the usual dumb charger. </p>

<p> Since the system uses bulbs that have plastic bits molded around
them, you can't use MR-11 bulbs provided by other manufactorers
(e.g. VistaLite, NiteRider). However, despite the added molded plastic
bits, the SunSport bulbs cost the same as these other bulbs. </p>

<p> In my opinion, the SunSport includes exactly the right ingredients
for a helmet light (except a good charger), and nothing more. It is so
well designed that randonneurs are buying them and rigging up mounts
to attach them to their bikes for use on long-distance
night-rides. </p>
