<P>As Wilfried Schmidt is himself a designer and manufacturer of cycle
lighting generators, you might suspect a degree of bias. To ensure
that this should not occur, the tests were independently audited by a
professional engineer (and Munich cycle dealer): Thomas
Metzmacher. And by the time you read this, articles based on the same
data will also have appeared in Velo<I>Plus</I> (Switzerland) and
Radwelt (magazine of the ADFC - German CTC equivalent).</P>

<P>Wilfried's colleague Andreas Oehler sent the 'raw data' for me to
check and I also questioned him closely regarding the details of the
test method. I found that they had been so careful not to favour their
own product that they were indeed a little <I>un</I>fair to it. Wheel
drag was not subtracted for this and other integral hub
generators. It's a small effect, but I have corrected for it anyway
(see <a href="#method">Test Method</a> for details) so that all types of
generator are compared in a similar way: this being purely upon the
basis of extra effort, above that normally required to propel a
bicycle. For this reason our figures are slightly different to those
already published in other magazines. </P>

<a name="bottles">
<h2>Bottles, Rollers and Hubs</h2></a>

<blockquote>

<P>The most common type of generator needs no introduction:
it looks like and is called a <I>bottle</I>. It drives off the side of
the tyre and is usually mounted with the drive pulley in front of the
mounting. Forward facing is assumed when designating a left or
right-handed model, although a left handed generator may also be
mounted facing backwards on the right-hand-side of the bicycle, and
vice versa. For this test bottle generators were always mounted to
drive forwards.</P>

<P>There are two classes of bottle: which differ in the way they move
the pulley towards the tyre. One type tilts over, pivoting about an
axis at right angles to its centre-line. For this <I>tilting</I>
design, drive direction usually makes no difference to
performance. But when a <I>hinged</I> type - which swings like a
door about a parallel axis - is mounted backwards, contact pressure
invariably increases. This may reduce the chance of pulley slip but
also increases drag.</P>

<P>Bottles are simple, cheap and more efficient than most people will
credit. However they are a bit prone to slip in wet conditions. This
can generally be avoided by careful adjustment and appropriate choice
of tyre, but may be harder to eliminate on oily urban main roads.</P>

<P><I>Roller</I> generators are known as bottom-bracket type in
Britain, but not by foreigners: who cunningly find other (less dirty)
places to mount a roller. Anyway: the generator is itself the roller,
driven by contact with the centre tread of the tyre. rollers </P>

<P>Rollers need a high contact pressure to work in the rain, because
water centrifuges out to this part of the tyre and is channelled onto
the roller by the rear mudguard. They are nevertheless preferred by
those who want to site their generator inconspicuously. There is also
a belief that the larger diameter (compared to the common bottle-type
pulley) must reduce drag. Noise is certainly reduced, not least by
intervening parts of the bike and the riders body. But all is not as
it may seem or sound!</P>

<P>Putting the generator in or on the hub eliminates drive
uncertainties. And a desire for reliability has spawned many designs
of <I>integral </I>hub and <I>hub-driven</I> generators. These can be
classified in two ways. They either turn with the hub, or are
<I>geared</I> (with gears or belts) so as to boost the rotational
speed of the generator. And they are either <I>fixed</I> to turn all
the time, or are <I>clutched</I>, so that the generator may be
disengaged when lights are not required. Ungeared hubs need lots of
magnetic poles to compensate for the slow rotational speed, but these
do not necessarily weigh any more than gears etc. Gears are less
efficient too, so geared hubs are usually clutched to eliminate
residual drag and unnecessary wear.</P>

<h2>Electrical Output</h2></a>

<center>
<IMG SRC="images/output_chart.gif" WIDTH=575 HEIGHT=476>
</center>

<blockquote>

<P>People often ask me to recommend a powerful dynamo, but
as you can see from the graph, they are mostly the same in this
respect. This isn't surprising when you consider that they are all
intended to power the same 6&nbsp;volt, 3&nbsp;watt lighting set
(invariably split 2.4W front, 0.6W rear). Differences occur mainly
above the 3&nbsp;W level. But even these are hardly sufficient to be
noticed in the brightness of your lights, so I wouldn't blame you
for skipping the next few paragraphs and going directly to something
more interesting!</P>

<P>In other words all generators are equal, but some are more equal
than others. And you do not really want your generator to be 'more
equal', since burning them brighter than intended can significantly
damage the health of your bulbs. Thankfully, modern halogen headlamps
include Zener diode voltage limiters. So did the test load. But these
are not simple on/off devices. They leak power over a range of
voltages so your bulbs may still get a bit cooked by an over-powerful
generator, especially if you are a speedy rider.</P>

<P>It's worth noting that dynamo lighting is optimised for the mass of
ordinary utility riders and made to pass German standards - which
demand that a generator reaches 95% of its rated output by 15km/h (a
mere 9mph). The British cycling scene is entirely different to the
rest of Northern Europe. Here dynamo lighting is the province of
cycling enthusiasts. Not all but most of them probably ride a good
deal faster than the average German housewife; and such enthusiasm can
play havoc with bulb life, generator over-heating etc. Some keen types
fit over-sized pulleys (home-made or bodged) to equate their miles per
hour with Frau Radler's kilometres, also reducing the drag and often
improving traction. (You should at least fit a pulley cap.)
Paradoxically the <I>less</I> powerful models are often preferable,
but the differences shown here are in any case quite small. I wouldn't
worry much up to about 4&nbsp;watts.</P>

<P>Possible exceptions are the Bisy Bike RND2 (to be avoided by speed
merchants), the Union 9501 Roller (a good one for slower riders) and
the Jenymo (which is a special case that I'll not go into here).</P>

</blockquote>

<a name="drag">
<h2>It's a drag</h2></a>

<center>
<IMG SRC="images/drag_chart.gif" WIDTH=576 HEIGHT=475>
</center>

<blockquote>

<P>Everyone (who doesn't use one) complains that dynamos
slow you down. Well okay, of course they do, but I suggest that the
slowing down has more to do with psychology than the actual power
required to turn it. It takes energy to make a noise, your energy. Add
the lowering tone (eee becomes urrr) as speed drops on a hill and it
becomes hard not to believe this morale sapping device is responsible
blame for the pain in your legs and the sweat on your brow! </P>

<P>There <I>have</I> been some crude and nasty ones, but the drag of
any decent modern generator is rather insignificant. This is
especially so at low speed and compared to the resistance afforded by
any recognisable hill. But no one wants to work any harder than they
<I>have</I> to. This makes <B>Generator Drag</B> an interesting
subject. And striking differences in power input make this a much more
interesting graph. Take a look at it now. You'll see that I've also
plotted the amount of extra effort for a 75kg person to ride a 15kg
bicycle up hills of various gradients, over and above that required on
a flat road. </P>

<P>I wrote hills but you can hardly call them that. All of the
generators were easier to turn than riding up a 1 in 300
slope. Another way of putting that is a rise of 18 feet per mile; and
there's quite a cluster of sidewall and hub-driven models around the
1/500 line, or 10&nbsp;ft per mile. If that's a hill I'm a Dutchman!
Let's put this into another context. Our 90kg (total) cyclist must
produce about 70W to maintain 20&nbsp;km/h on the flat. If he turns on
his dynamo he needs another 6W minimum, 14W maximum. He can work a bit
harder or slow to 19&nbsp;km/h, 18 minimum. Now that's not <I>too</I>
bad is it?</P>

<P>For those who simply must have the least drag possible: 1/1000 (6
fpm) is achieved by the two best hub generators. Both of these, and
one other hub-mounted model, are of the fixed type. This means that
the generator cannot be disengaged and always turns with the wheel. So
there is always some extra drag - relative to that of a normal wheel -
even when the lights are switched off. This <I>residual drag</I> is
also shown by dashed lines on the graph. It's generally much less than
when electricity is flowing in the generator (for if it's doing no
work it should take less work to turn it) and in Schmidt's Original
the residual drag amounts to less than one foot of climbing per
mile. Feel that and it is <I>you</I> who must be the Dutchman! </P>

<P>Residual drag is not so well controlled by Shimano and
Pioneer. Indeed: above a certain speed (23 and 37 km/h respectively)
their generators become <I>easier</I> to turn with the lights switched
on again! (I can only speculate that this may be due to inefficient
eddy currents in their armatures, which are perhaps not laminated.)
But note nevertheless, that they demand less effort than to climb 7
feet per mile.</P>

</blockquote>

<a name="compare">
<h2>Horses for courses</h2></a>

<blockquote>

<P>To make it easy for you to compare the models tested,
and decide which one best meets your requirements, I've produced three
charts that rate them best at top, worst at bottom, in three distinct
performance criteria.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Low Speed Power</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/low_power.gif" WIDTH=381 HEIGHT=423 align=right>

<P>As it says, this is the power output at 10&nbsp;km/h
(6¼&nbsp;mph). That's the kind of speed an average rider gets down to
on a steep hill. An elderly or disabled rider might often be reduced
to such a low speed by an incline or headwind. And it may difficult to
ride much faster on some cycle paths, where poor surfaces, sightlines
and obstacles make a good light all the more important! If plenty of
power at low speed is a priority for your kind of cycling, choose one
of those near the top of this list. But if you don't have energy to
spare, also give a thought to Efficiency.</P>

</blockquote>
<br clear=all>

<h4>Normal Speed Efficiency</h4>

<blockquote>

<P><IMG SRC="images/normal_eff.gif" WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=423 align="right">

<P>This is the chart for the average touring and commuting
rider. It rates generators for the best trade-off between maximum
light and minimum effort, at 20&nbsp;km/h (12½&nbsp;mph). Frequent
cyclists, (not super-athletes) generally tootle along at about that
speed. They should go by this chart, especially if they do a lot of
riding in the dark. But also pay attention to High Speed Drag.</P>

</blockquote>
<br clear=all>

<h4>High Speed Drag</h4>

<blockquote>

<IMG SRC="images/high_drag.gif" WIDTH=385 HEIGHT=423 align="right">

<P>There's not much point in having a more efficient generator if
that means more electrical power for the same drag. Excess power
simply blows your bulbs. And since there's nothing wrong with the
output of most of the models we've looked at, minimum input is a far
more interesting proposition. This is especially true for fit,
high-speed, long distance riders. If you often get up to 30&nbsp;km/h
(19&nbsp;mph) this is your chart.</P>

<P>Note that this chart also includes the residual (lights off) drag
for fixed hub generators. These can be switched off electrically but
still turn with the wheel. They are rated according to the sum of
generating plus residual drag (the latter being zero for other
types). This represents a journey half in the dark and half in
daylight. The more you ride in daylight - at any speed - the less
residual drag you will want, so consult this chart if you're
contemplating a fixed hub generator.</P>

</blockquote>
<br clear=all>

<a name="summaries">
<h2>Product summaries</h2></a>

<h4>AXA-HR</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Hinged type bottle generator (recommended in CTC mag p28 A/M
93). First modern high-efficiency design and still one of the very
best thanks to a large diameter, knurled and hardened steel roller. My
benchmark for comparison with other models and types of
generator. Early versions suffered from seized bearings due to
corroded rotor shafts but these are now stainless. Has a very strong
pressure spring, seldom slips, but may exert too much contact pressure
when mounted backwards. Incorporates zener overload protection and has
neat, separate electrical connections.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Bisy Bike RND2</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Geared integral hub generator previously produced under the
name of S'Light (reviewed in CTC mag p24 D/J 96). Epicyclic gearing
can be de-clutched for free running, but proved unreliable: few
surviving one season of regular use. The '2' indicates that this may
be a <I>new improved</I> version. The data shows it to be more
efficient than the AXA at low speed, but no better than the average
bottle at normal to high speed. Large diameter and quite heavy.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>FER 2002</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Latest version of this unique, hub-driven generator that fits
neatly onto the side of an existing front wheel. (Reviewed in CTC mag
p33 F/M 92) Clutched by flipping a lever into the spokes and geared by
internal toothed belts. It can easily be fitted - to anything from a
racer to a mountain-bike - and the data show it to be one of the
easiest of all to propel. Although it has attractions to high-speed
and long-distance riders, experience with the first (GS2000 and 2001)
versions indicate problems with heat-induced distortion of the plastic
body, resulting in misalignment, stripped teeth and broken belts. Few
problems are reported by slower, short-distance riders; and the 2002
can at least be dismantled for maintenance.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>FER Powerlight L95</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Ordinary hinged type bottle generator from FER. A recent design
but with the highest drag and lowest output of its type. Users report
poor durability from FER bottles (plastic bodied ones anyway) so not
recommended.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Jenymo</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Unique Swiss-made bottle with integral back-up battery (keeps
the lights on for up to 10 minutes when you stop) that is continuously
charged by the generator. Measurements were made with this battery
fully charged, to minimise the effect on output of this self-charging
feature. However it is probably unfair to compare its output and
efficiency with simple generators, since the charging circuit is sure
to consume some power. Many would consider lower output when moving to
be a fair exchange for <I>continued</I> output when stationary. Drag
is similar to the average tyre-driven generator. The Jenymo is a
hinged type, only a little larger than an ordinary bottle (it weighs
180g) and fits to the same kind of bracket. Unfortunately this product
does not appear to be available in the UK.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Marwi</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>This Danish company (say it <I>Marvi</I>) have bought Soubitez
and Union, so there are several products below that may have this name
instead when you see them in the shops.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Nordlicht 2000R</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Old-fashioned bottle generator, but quite efficient and very
quiet thanks to the rubber drive ring. It's the tilting type, was
reviewed in the CTC mag (p33 A/S 95) and is sold in our shop. It was
tested as supplied with a small (22&nbsp;mm o.d.) ring. The
alternative steel pulley is similar and both are sized to maximise
output at 15&nbsp;km/h, as required by German regulations. The
replacement rubber ring is larger (26&nbsp;mm), improves traction and
should reduce drag by at least 15%. This is recommended for use by
normal/faster riders, for whom the reduction in output is a benefit
rather than a drawback. Performance with this larger ring is probably
very similar to the AXA. The Nordlicht is more reliable than most
bottles: the metal body helps it to withstand prolonged high-speed
running.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Pioneer Spanninga</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>This new hub-mounted generator (mentioned in CTC mag p39 D/J
97) mounts on a rear Shimano freehub. The output is standard 6V, 3W,
but it is mainly intended to be used with its dedicated lighting
system. Although it's quite efficient when generating, it cannot be
de-clutched and still exerts significant drag when it isn't. But the
effects of drag should not be exaggerated (this one will slow you only
by about 5%) and some may nevertheless appreciate the high-tech
features (lights come on automatically when it gets dark) of the
system as a whole.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Renak Enparlite</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Very compact integral, geared, clutched hub generator mentioned
in CTC mag p39 D/J 97. Arc Marketing sent me a sample last year and I
was not initially impressed: drive engagement was sticky and the three
tiny epicyclic gear trains made a discouraging din. However: after a
lengthy running in period it has not worn out (as expected), seems
less noisy and perhaps somewhat easier to propel. This test shows that
while it is not especially efficient, drag is comparable with a good
bottle and of course it is not affected at all by the weather. Could
be worth a second look if it becomes available in the UK.</P>

</blockquote>

<table width=35% border="1" align="right" hspace=2 vspace=2 cellpadding="7">
<tr><td>
<h4>Schmidt Original &nbsp;
<i><font size=+1 color="#9900FF">Best&nbsp;in&nbsp;Test</font></i></h4>

<P>Ungeared, integral hub generator: the dynohub concept brought
up to date. It comes complete with a modified headlamp to switch off
the lights. You may know of the Union Wing (recommended in CTC mag p34
O/N 96 - now discontinued). This is essentially the same thing, taken
back and further improved by it's original inventor, e.g. by fitting
better bearings. These are inaccessible, but the manufacturer
guarantees to take care of any problems. And although this model is
not at the top of <I>every</I> table (e.g. some other generators
slightly exceed its output at low speed), it's clearly best in
test. So it should be, it costs the most! Without Shimano the Schmidt
Original stands head and shoulders above the competition. And against
Shimano it has the advantage of extremely low residual drag. By my
reckoning it knocks only ½% off your average speed. These
characteristics will be especially appreciated by Audax and other
long-distance, high-speed riders. </P>

<p> If you want the best, the Schmidt Original is now available from
the CTC shop. </p> 

</td></tr></table>

<h4>Shimano Inter-L</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Another ungeared integral hub generator, but at a keen price
(about £55). The Inter-L is a very close competitor for the Schmidt
Original, indeed it has slightly less generating drag above
28&nbsp;km/h. Its only fault is that drag is hardly reduced by turning
off the lights. Indeed: if you want to ride faster than 23&nbsp;km/h
(14&nbsp;mph) you had better keep them on! The effect of this drag
should not however be exaggerated. It's like a gradient of merely
1&nbsp;in&nbsp;900 and reduces speed by less than 4%. This will not be
noticed by most riders, who may nevertheless appreciate its
reliability and user-serviceable bearings.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Shimano Inter-L*</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Instead of a modified lamp: Shimano supply a handlebar-mounted
switch to which you can wire any standard dynamo lighting. This switch
also contains a Zener regulator to protect the lamps from excess
power. It cuts in at a lower voltage than the regulator you generally
get inside a halogen headlamp, reducing power output even at slow
speeds and resulting in a lower efficiency score.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Soubitez Electra</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Modern, stylish design of bottle generator (hinged type) from
this well known French manufacturer. Slightly lower than average
output, but less drag than most makes it a competent performer. I've
always got value for money out of Soubitez, so it's probably a sound
choice especially for speedy riders on a budget.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Union Roller 8601</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>If you <I>must</I> stick your generator under the
bottom-bracket, I used to reckon this is the only one worth
having. But it's heavier, more expensive, less efficient and on
average less durable than a bottle, so you really <I>should</I>
reconsider the options. The 8601 is operated via a cable and lever on
the seat-tube, so you can easily reduce drag by turning it off.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Union Roller 9501</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>New, more compact design of roller from Union, also known as
the Maus (mouse) - probably because of the way it runs along the top
of the tyre. You can get it neatly combined with a headlamp to fit in
front of the fork crown. It has excellent output characteristics, but
is just as draggy as the 8601.</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Union Tramp</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Ordinary bottle generator from the ubiquitous German. Comes a
few places behind its more costly stablemate in the rankings, but
actual performance figures are very close. Excellent value for
money. Why pay more?</P>

</blockquote>

<h4>Union Turbo</h4>

<blockquote>

<P>Ultra-compact, highly efficient and good-looking bottle
generator. Got a dud when reviewed for CTC mag (p33 O/N 96 and p42 F/M
97), but feedback from members is much more encouraging. It's the
tilting type so shouldn't be affected by drive direction. However,
some report a tendency to slip when mounted backwards, probably due to
the pivot sticking when pushed this way. A bit noisy but performance
is on a par with the AXA-HR. One of the best bottles.</P>

</blockquote>

<a name="method">
<h2>Test Method</h2></a>

<blockquote>

<P>A special testing machine was built, upon which a wheel
and any known type of cycle lighting generator could be mounted. The
cycle wheel was coupled to a large (30&nbsp;kg) flywheel and
accelerated by an electric motor to maximum speed. Then the motor was
disengaged and speed monitored by computer as the wheel was retarded
(mainly) by the generator. The computer was programmed to calculate
the rate of deceleration and the power consumption (having first
measured the inertia of the flywheel and bicycle wheel by a pendulum
method) over a range of speeds. </P>

<P>Calibration tests were also conducted without a generator, and
without even a cycle wheel on the rig. From these the aerodynamic and
bearing drag of the flywheel and cycle wheel could be calculated, and
subtracted as appropriate from the test data. Whilst bearing friction
(in the cycle wheel <I>and</I> test machine) should be relatively
small, spokes act like a centrifugal fan, producing significant
aerodynamic drag even when a wheel is not moving forwards. (Disk
wheels may be especially recommended for roller racing!) All these
factors were found to be much less than generator drag, which could
therefore be calculated with adequate accuracy. </P>

<P>The computer also monitored electrical output during tests with the
generator running. Cycle light bulbs etc. are insufficiently reliable
for test purposes, so voltage was measured across a high quality
12&nbsp;ohm resistor (1%, 50W) with parallel 7.8&nbsp;volt Zener
diodes (BZW7V8B). These components model the usual kind of 6V, 3W
dynamo lighting system, with which all the generators tested were
intended to be used.</P>

<P>Because they are less than 100% efficient, generators get warm
during use. This alters their electrical and mechanical properties; so
each was run for 5 minutes at 15&nbsp;km/h before accelerating to
50&nbsp;km/h for the 'coast down' test. </P>

<P>A programme of pre-testing investigated warming up and other
factors. The most important variable emerging from this programme was
pulley pressure. The Union 8601 Roller presses especially hard against
the tyre with a force of about 20 Newtons&nbsp;(N). When this was
reduced to 10&nbsp;N by means of an external spring, drag was cut by
about one third. Old, used roller generators are more efficient
because their old springs don't press so hard, but of course then they
slip in the rain.</P>

<P>During the main tests all sidewall (bottle) generators were mounted
with an off-gap of 10&nbsp;mm, which generally resulted in a contact
pressure (when engaged with the tyre) of about 10&nbsp;N, while roller
generators were positioned at a distance half-way between just
touching when on and off respectively - so as to produce a pressure
midway between the minimum and maximum obtainable. Note that the
official German Standards test differs by prescribing a 10&nbsp;N
pressure, which makes models with strong springs look much more
efficient than they typically are. Such official results (however
misleading) tend get quoted in catalogues etc.</P>

<P>At least three samples of each model were tested. Rather than
average the results, Andreas took those provided by the 'most typical'
sample - with a performance that lay between the extremes of its
namesakes.</P>
