This is a quote from a message on the bikecurrent mailing list last week
from Matt O'Toole:

        NiMH do have their downsides.  First, there's the charging
        issue:  it's not difficult to build a good NiMH charger, it's
        just that nicad chargers are everywhere, and NiMH hasn't taken
        over yet.  Also, NiMH can be damaged more easily by leaving
        them on a trickle charger.  NiMH have very high self discharge
        rates, about three times that of nicads.  So, they're far less
        tolerant of storage, and not well suited to intermittent use.
        They last through far fewer cycles than nicads, so continually
        topping them up will shorten their life.  Finally, they're
        expensive.  Though cell prices are dropping, and will probably
        match nicads' soon, they'll always be much more expensive when
        their much shorter life is factored in.


<p> Because the batteries get hot after they are fully charged, the
best method of detecting a full battery is to monitor the temperature
of the battery and go to the low current when the battery starts
heating up. This is called the dT/dt method. Altough this is the best
method of doing smart charging, it is not the method that we use for
our smart charger, since it would involve putting thermistors in with
the battery pack, and providing an extra cord from the battery to the
charger to detect the temperature. Furthermore, the charger would be
more expensive. </p>
