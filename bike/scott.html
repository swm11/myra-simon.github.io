<p> Let's be honest. The Scott Tigua isn't the sort of bike that you lie
awake at night dreaming about. It isn't expensive. It doesn't have
suspension. While the paint job is tasteful, it doesn't elicit
admiring glances from passers by. The tires are better suited to
street use and the odd canal towpath than serious off-road work.  No,
this is the sort of bike you buy because it's reasonably priced and
you think it'll do the job. The only question is, how well does it do
its job? </p> 

<p> The Tigua is the entry point to Scott's Solution series: a line of
bikes designed for women. The fact that it's a women's bike seems
well known. A few times I've had people coming up to me to talk to me
about it and ask me how I get on with it. </p> 

<p> The frame is straight-gauge 7005 aluminium in a standard diamond.
There's no fancy bending of seatstay or exotic tube shapes, although
there are some nice cutouts at the rear dropouts. There's a gusset on
the underside of the down tube at the head tube, but it's welded at
the end as well as along the edges, which concentrates stress at the
end weld. At least it looks the part. It has a plain curved steel fork
which is extra tall, so if you replace it with a suspension fork the
geometry shouldn't get too messed up. The paintwork is neat, but not
very durable: the cables of my lights rubbed through it on one night
ride. It has all the braze-ons for rack and mudguards, although the
tall fork would make attachment of a full front mudguard a fiddle. </p>

<p> The wheels are decent, although budget. The "Formula RBP" hubs are
alloy, and there are 32 14-gauge stainless spokes laced to Alex
rims. The rims are a simple U shape, without eyelets, and the braking
surface isn't all that wide, making precise alignment of brakes a
necessity. The surprising thing about the wheels is that despite the
basic components, the quality of the wheelbuilding is excellent. These
are very well-tensioned wheels, and as long as the hubs don't go
belly-up I expect them to give good service until the sidewalls wear
thin. I don't know if this quality of wheelbuilding is standard for
Scott, or if it was tweaked by the shop I got the bike from, <a
href="http://www.bothybikes.co.uk/page2.html">Bothy Bikes</a> in
Aviemore. </p>

<p> Since this is a woman's bike, it's worth examining how well it
fulfills that role. See my article on <a href="what_women.html">What
to look for in a women's bike</a>. First, let's consider the top tube
length. I have the 17.5" model, the second smallest. Its top tube is,
according to the geometry charts, 53.5cm (about 21") long. The charts
for my old Trek 950 (a non women-specific MTB) list its top tube as
56cm (22") long. However in reality, the head tube is the same
distance from the seat tube on both bikes. Trek gives the "effective
top tube" measurement, which is how long the top tube would be if it
were horizontal, while Scott gives the actual length of the tube which
is shorter. If you measure the "effective top tube" length of the
Scott you find it's also 56cm (22"). </p>

<p> So the Tigua isn't a real winner here, but it is quite short for a
Scott. The geometry charts list the 17.5" Sport models as having a
55.5cm top tube, and the Racing versions a 56cm top tube. Assuming the
same method of measuring, that would be a heck of a stretch. In
contrast, the 17" versions of Trek's women's specific 6500 and 8000
have effective top tubes of 53.4cm (21"). So if you're looking for a
really short reach, look to Trek. </p> 

<p> Returning to my two bikes, the top tube on the Scott slopes more
than the Trek.  Although the seat tubes of the bikes are the same
length, the top tube on the Scott joins the seat tube well below the
top. This gives you more crotch clearance, but prevents the use of a
big waterbottle on the seat tube. Not a problem if you're a Camelbak
fan. </p>

<IMG SRC="images/scott-bar.jpg" alt="bars and stem"
 ALIGN="left" BORDER="0" width=270 height=158 hspace="5">

<p> Now let's look to the handlebar and stem to see what sort of a riding
position you'll get. The Tigua comes with a fashionable (although
heavy steel) riser bar. At 24" it's of moderate width, and it should
help to bring the grips up and back to the rider. However as soon as I
sat on the bike I felt way too stretched. It's the stem at fault. It's
115mm long with almost no rise. Since the headset is threadless and
there is only a slim spacer, there is no chance for height
adjustment. What is this doing on a small ladies bike? My old Trek,
not specifically designed for women, came with a stem of the same rise
but a centimeter shorter. Since it didn't have a threadless headset, I
could raise the stem by quite a bit. I wonder if Scott had some
leftover stems from their mens race bikes, and they stuck them on the
Tigua to get rid of them. Whatever, it certainly doesn't belong. My
local bike shop sorted me out with a stem about 85mm long and with
about a 20degree rise. Ah, much better. </p> 

<p> A quick trip around the block told me that the Scott Solution
saddle didn't suit me.  Now, women usually have wider sit bones than
men, and I certainly don't have a very slim backside. But this saddle
was too wide for me, getting in the way of my legs and preventing me
from getting the weight properly over the sit bones. So I ditched it.
Instead I put on a plastic-covered Bontrager FS+10 which I find works
well for me: it's not too wide or narrow, and it has a fair amount of
padding, but not so much that I sink in. </p>

<p> Something that ought to feature on women's bike, but rarely does,
is <a href="cranks.html">short cranks</a>. These are needed because
women, being on average shorter than men, typically have shorter
legs. I find I get on best with 165mm cranks, and I have put these on
my Trek. I can tolerate the 170mm cranks that come on all sizes of the
Tigua, but anyone who's small enough to ride the 16" would be
much better off with shorter cranks. </p>

<p> After getting the bike sufficiently adjusted to suit me, I slapped on
some clipless pedals and took it for a ride.  Quite a few rides in
fact, over a couple of months. At first it impressed me by being quite
nimble in the singletrack. It's not particularly light (about 28
pounds according to my bathroom scale), but the riser bars really help
with control. My Trek has flat bars, just shy of 23", with bar ends. I
found with the risers I got alot more leverage to both guide the front
wheel and to lean the bike into the curves. Before trying this bike I
hadn't been a fan of riser bars, dismissing them as simply the current
fashion. But hey, they work. At least these ones do. I still don't
think I'd get along with the ultra-wide bars you get on some bikes. </p> 

<p> The bike is at its best in smooth, twisty tracks. Taken out on
rough surfaces, you either find a line between the bumps or you get
jolted about and have to struggle to keep the bike on course. </p> 

<p> I was quite pleased with the shifting, provided by Gripshift ESP 5.0
shifters and rear derailleur, with Shimano sneaking in with an Acera
front mech. This was my first experience with Gripshift, and I found I
get along with it very well. I like the fact the I don't even have to
move my hands to shift: just tighten a couple of fingers and
twist. Simple. Gear changes were usually reliable, but a couple of
times it acted up in the mud, refusing to shift. Similarly, the
brakes work fine too, although they're currently in a squealing mood
and I need to sort them out. </p> 

<IMG SRC="images/scott-tire.jpg" alt="tire pattern"
 ALIGN="right" BORDER="0" width=189 height=133 hspace="5">

<p> The tires weren't quite up to off-road riding. Scott seemed to be
assuming (not unreasonably) that this bike would be used mostly on the
road. So it came with tires that are almost perfectly smooth in the
middle, with a row of knobblies on the edges. The knobblies do help
provide grip in corners, but they don't help much when you're going
straight over soft ground: staying upright becomes more a matter of
balance than traction. For winter use I've swapped in some skinny 1.7"
mud tires. They give far superior grip, and at about 500 grams each,
they reduce the weight of the bike almost 1 pound per tire (the
original tires were a porky 900 grams). </p>

<p> In summary, this is a great bike to get you out on the trails. With
the exception of a far too long and low stem, the geometry is good,
and as long as you put some knobbly tires on it it'll attack the
singletrack with enthusiasm. Simply put, it is great fun. I didn't
expect to like it this much, so I'm surprised to find myself ignoring
my heavily upgraded Trek to take out the Scott when the tracks aren't
too technical. Since the Tigua has a pretty good frame, you can
upgrade at your leisure to make the bike lighter and more suitable for
difficult terrain (via things like clipless pedals and a suspension
fork). </p> 

<h4>The more things change, the more they stay the same</h4>

<IMG SRC="images/scott-2000.jpg" alt="2000 Tigua"
 ALIGN="left" BORDER="0" width=354 height=202 hspace="5">

<p> The Tigua I have is the 1999 version. The 2000 version has been
significantly revamped. The most noticiable changes are in the frame,
which is used for all but the top bike in the Solution series. The
color and shapes of the frame tubes of the new Tigua really catch the
eye. My bike is a mild-mannered black and white with red bits. The new
Tigua is a vibrant orange and blue-black. You wouldn't think that tube
shapes would catch anyone's attention, but these certainly do.  They
are flattened and squashed into some interesting profiles that change
along the length of the tubes (Scott calls this Bi-Axial tubing). This
certainly adds interest to the look of the frame, although I don't
know whether it changes the ride of the bike. There are lots of other
changes too when you look closely. Gone is Gripshift, replaced by a
basic Shimano drivetrain. The wheels are now shod in MTB semi-slicks
instead of the fat slicks, which should result in better grip
off-road. The threadless headset has been replaced by an old-fashioned
threaded one, although at least the stem is a much more appropriate
85mm length and can be raised. </p>

<p> The geometry and riser bar seem to be unchanged, so I expect the new
Tigua will be just as fun slaloming down the singletrack. In addition
the orange bits and cool tube profiling will help prevent those boring
bike blues. Thus the new Tigua is likely to be as good an investment
as the old: a bike that will get you rolling right away, with a frame
that is worthy of upgrades should you choose to make them. </p>

<h4>Update 2003</h4>

<p> Now that I have a baby I'm spending lots more bicycle time <a
href="riding-with-baby.html">hauling my daughter around town</a> than
slaloming along singletrack, and so the Scott has been revamped into a
round-town bike. This bike is sufficiently flexible that this was an
easy conversion to make, and it serves its new purpose marvellously.
I am still an enthusiastic owner of this bicycle! <br clear=all>
