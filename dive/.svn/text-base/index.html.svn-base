<h1>Myra's Diving Pages</h1>

<blockquote>

<p> I've always wanted to go scuba diving. As a kid I was engrossed by
the Jaques Cousteau specials, and I wanted to be there to discover it
myself. Still, it took me a long time to get into it. I first got my
PADI Open Water certification in 1988 or so, but then I didn't dive
for the next 10 years. Mainly this was because I didn't have any
friends who were into diving, and I wasn't sufficiently motivated to
do it on my own. </p>

<p> In September 1998 my boyfriend (now husband) Simon and I were
spending some time in Austrialia, and I proposed that we should take
diving courses, where he'd get certified while I relearned
everything. So we did, with Kelly Dive in Airlie Beach. Simon got his
Open Water certification, and I got my Advanced Open Water. Then we
spent a few days on a liveaboard on the Whitsunday Islands where we
got to see lots of cool organisms. </p>

<p> Here are brief descriptions of the diving we (or I) have done
since getting qualified. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Red Sea, March 2000. Since we hadn't been diving in awhile we
took a Scuba tune-up course with the local dive shop to make sure we'd
be familiar with the equipment, tables, etc. So then we spent a few
days diving in with Emperor Divers in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Simon
had problems with his ears on the second day, so I did the third day
on my own. I found that my main interest was in "fishspotting":
learning the names and facts about the underwater organisms that I
encountered. I bought Helmut Debelius's <i>Red Sea Reef Guide</i>
to help me with this task. </p>

<li> <p> Gozo, July 2001. This was during our honeymoon. We
went with St Andrews Diver's Cove in Xlendi, Gozo. This time Simon
again had trouble with his ears (on the second dive) so he explored
Gozo on foot and by bus while I spent some time underwater.  </p>

<li> <p> Monterey Bay, California, February 2002. Simon went to a
conference in California, so I rented a car and drove south for some
diving with the Monterey Bay Dive Center. Since there were no groups
going, I got a guide for two dives.  Monterey Bay is quite cold in
February, and I wore a super-thick wetsuit, a hood, and neoprene
gloves. I found that my booties weren't quite up to the task of
keeping my feet warm: by the end of the second dive I could hardly
feel my feet. Still, it was worth it: saw several nudibranchs and
barber slugs, lots of anemones and starfish, and different kinds of
sea cucumber. The highlight was the Metridium field, a big area with
loads of large, ghostly white anemones. Diving in California is
definitely a matter of invertebrate spotting rather than fish
spotting. </p>

<li> <p> Tenerife, Canary Islands, April 2004. Water temperature: 18
degrees C. Max depth for the trip was around 25 meters. I had a break
from scuba diving because of being pregnant with my daughter (Ellen),
and then feeling that she was too young to be away from me for long
periods of time. But finally she was more than a year old and I felt I
could leave her for much of the day and have Simon look after her
while I went under the waves. So whilst on holiday in Tenerife I got
in a few dives with Atliantic Divers. I was a bit disappointed:
although there was a good selection of fish, there wasn't much
attached to the rocks: very little in the way of coral, anemones,
sponges, you name it. Just lots and lots of very nasty looking sea
urchins with long black spines. Still I enjoyed being underwater
again, and I got to try out the dive computer that Simon had gotten me
for Christmas. Now after diving with one, I wouldn't want to be
without! </p>

<li> <p> Monterey Bay, California, August 2004. Water temp: 13C. We
were in CA visiting friends, so I convinced Simon that he and Ellen
could find some fun things to do while I did some diving. This time I
did 4 dives over 2 days, again with the Monterey Bay Dive Center. In
some ways it wasn't as good as my diving here in Feb 2002: the kelp
was at its peak of growth, so you had to get through lots of it to get
out to the dive sites (I did shore diving, as I did the previous
time). The real problem though was that there was a Red Tide, which
meant that the top few meters of water were thick with algae and it
was difficult to see anything. Below that the water was much clearer,
but much darker than on my previous visit, so I didn't see the
wonderful creatures stuck to the rocks as well as I had last time. But
my guide Dave made good use of my low air comsumption, and we did some
quite long dives. We spent alot of time out in the Metridium fields,
which I loved as much as last time. </p>

<li> <p> Jersey, Channel Islands, July 2005. Water temp: 18C, max
depth less than 10 meters. We were on Jersey for a family holiday:
Simon Ellen and me, and Simon's parents. I booked three days of diving
with H2O Sports in St. Helier. There weren't any regular dive groups
going out, so I got a guide, who turned out to be Phil, the guy who
owns the dive shop/school! All the dives we did were in bays on the
northeast side of the island: St. Catherine's Bay, Bouley Bay, Bonne
Nuit. The visibility wasn't great, as the warmer water temps had
triggered a plankton bloom, but there was still lots to see. The rocks
had some fish (mostly wrasse) swimming around them and plenty of
things attached to them: snails, seaweeds of different varieties, sea
squirts. There were some areas of short kept, about 1.5m long, that
looked beautiful as it swayed in the surge. The kelp had its own
little ecosystem, with all sorts of interesting things attached to
it. Out on the sandy areas there was plenty to see as well: lobsters
small (tiny ones that hid in the links of big chains) and large
(edible ones that hid under rocky overhangs by day and walked along
the sand at night), all sorts of crabs including hermit crabs, mostly
inhabiting whelk shells. I saw plenty of whelks, some scallops, a good
number of cuttlefish, and one squid (seen on a night dive). Also saw
some different kinds of anemones, including some (incorrectly called
parasitic anemones) attached to the shells of hermit crabs. </p>

<li> <p> Hughada, Egypt, February 2008. Max Depth 30 meters. It had
been a few years since my last dive, and I was desperate to get back
to it. This time, instead of leaving my family to fend for themselves
while we all were on holiday, I went on a holiday on my own! I went
with Emperor Divers again since I was so impressed with them last time
I was in Egypt. I took a Scuba tune-up course, and then did a week of
diving. Heaven! I discovered how important it is to keep your head
warm on a dive: I got quite cold on my first few dives, but then one
of my fellow divers loaned me his hood, and after that I was fine. On
this trip I also experimented with underwater photography, using my
Olympus digital camera with a scuba-worthy underwater housing. You can
see the results of my experiements <a

</p>

</ul>
      
<p> Becasue of the trouble Simon has with his ears, it looks like he
won't be doing much if any diving with me. But now that I've had a
taste of the underwater, I find that it's addictive, and I won't give
it up. So I will be doing diving on my own from now on (well, not on
my own, but being teamed up with a random buddy by a dive leader just
before the dive). </p>

<p> At present I'm still a fairly inexperienced scuba diver, having
done only a bit over 50 dives. Until December 2003 I only owned the
mask, snorkel, fins, boots, and dive watch that I bought in
Australia. However, for Christmas 2003 Simon bought me a dive
computer. Now I know just how much time I'm spending at which depth,
and, more importantly, the max amount I should be spending at each
depth before a decompression stop is advised. Knowing I'm keeping well
within the limits makes me a much more confident diver. It's also cool
to know the water temperature. </p>
